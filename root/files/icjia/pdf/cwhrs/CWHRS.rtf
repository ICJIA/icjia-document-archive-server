}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborators of the Chicago Womens\'92 Health Risk Study include people 
who represen\-t each participating site. However, many other people at the sites made 
signifi\-cant con\-tributions to the project. They include Bonnie Noe of the Chicago Depart\-
ment of Public Health; }{\plain \f1 Lois Furlow and Peggy Martin of the Chicago Department of 
Public Health}{\plain \f1  Roseland Clinic; Jan Alroy, Gloria Becerra, Rebecca Estrada, Caroline 
Makere and Proshat Shekarloo at the Hospital Crisis Intervention Program of Cook 
County Hospital; Sue Avila and Rob Smith of the Trauma Unit of Cook County Hospital; 
Louis Hirsch of the Chicago Abused Women\'92s Coalition; Denise Djohan, Hazel Pernell 
and Bernice Haines of Erie Family Health Center; and Felicia Grey at the Office of the 
Cook County Medical Examiner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Without the generous cooperation of the many agencies that allowed us access 
to their facilities, the Chicago Womens\'92 Health Risk Study would not have been suc\-
cess\-fully completed. We would like to acknowledge the following people in particular: at 
the Illinois Department of Corrections, Steve Karr, Planning and Research Unit, Warden 
Dan Bosse, and Assistant Warden Gwendolyn Thornton at Logan Correctional Center, 
and Warden Donna Klein-Acosta and Assistant Warden Janice Burns at Dwight 
Correctional Center; at the Office of the Cook County Circuit Court Clerk, Associate 
Clerk Gerard Sciaraffa; at the Illinois State Police Research Support Center Metropol\-
itan Chicago, Captain William Davis; at the Chicago Public Library Harold Washington 
Main Branch Interlibrary Loan Department, Valerie Samuelson.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The design and implementation of the proxy study part of the project greatly 
benefitted from the advice, suggestions and encouragement of those researchers who 
had pioneered this methodology. We would especially like to thank Joyce Banton, 
David C. Clark, Arthur Kellermann, Judith McFarlane and Harold Rose.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A cornerstone of the Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study was the culturally 
sensitive Spanish translations of the questionnaires and other instruments, as well as 
the sensitive interviewing procedures, which were made possible by the Erie Neighbor\-
hood Advisory Board, a group of people who met with Eva Hernandez over several 
months to work on translation and advise us on methods. The project owes a special 
debt to Nanette Benbow, Alicia Contreras, Eva Hernandez, Laura Safar and Luis 
Cavero, who generously spent long hours on the translations.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, we would like to thank the many people at the Illinois Criminal Justice 
Information Authority who understood the importance of this project and went above 
and beyond to find ways to make it happen. Some of the people who contributed 
significantly to the project\'92s success were Hank Anthony, Carrie Bluthardt, Robert 
Boehmer, Maureen DeMatoff, Tamlyn Hawthorne, Candice Kane, James Oas and 
Gerard Ramker.\par

{\plain \b\f1 ABSTRACT}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To help a broad array of practitioners identify women at greatest risk, the 
Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study (CWHRS) explored factors indicating signifi\-cant 
danger of death or life-threatening injury in intimate violence situations. A collabo\-ration 
of Chicago medical, pub\-lic health and criminal justice agencies, and domestic violence 
advocates, the CWHRS compared longitudinal interviews with physically abused 
women sampled at hospital and health centers with similar inter\-views of people who 
knew intimate partner homicide victims.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The project was based on analysis of lethal and non-lethal Chicago samples 
tracked through inter\-views over a profile year, plus a baseline comparison group of 
nonabused women. Retrospective profile years for the lethal sam\-ple, the 87 people 
killed by an intimate partner in 1995 or 1996 in Chicago, were obtained by inter\-views 
with a knowl\-edge\-able relative or friend, a proxy respondent. The 497 physically abused 
women were sam\-pled from pop\-u\-lations of hospital health clinic patients, interviewed 
about a retro\-spective profile year, and then tracked by pro\-spec\-tive inter\-views over a 
year. The 208 comparison women, not physically abused in the past year, were 
sampled from the same settings.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This design permits analysis of the interactive effects of events, changing 
circum\-stances and interventions on a lethal or life-threaten\-ing outcome, including 
stalking, harass\-ment and controlling behav\-ior; attempts to leave the rela\-tion\-ship; arrest 
and other inter\-ventions; and other circum\-stanc\-es such as pregnancy and gun avail\-abil\-i\-
ty. The CWHRS provides informa\-tion that could be used for develop\-ing col\-la\-bo\-ra\-tive 
strate\-gies to identify and intervene in potentially life-threat\-en\-ing intimate violence 
situations, and that can support informed decisions of field-level personnel such as beat 
officers and clinical staff.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The results of the CWHRS apply only to the populations in the neighborhoods 
sampled for the study. However, these populations include some women who are not 
represented in other research, such as women who are high-risk but who do not appear 
in the records of helping agencies. We hope that CWHRS results will provide a voice for 
these women to be heard by medical, police and other professionals.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 THE PROBLEM}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Despite the current proliferation of intimate violence studies, domestic violence 
advocates and policy makers in public health and criminal justice are often con\-fused 
about the efficacy of practical interven\-tions. Under what cir\-cumstances is a woman at 
risk if she terminates an abusive rela\-tion\-ship?  In what situa\-tions does arrest increase 
or decrease the risk of death? How do stalking and other harass\-ment interact with 
events and changing circum\-stanc\-es, such as gun owner\-ship, pregnancy or threats to 
children, to affect the risk of a lethal outcome?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Two methodological obstacles limit research answers to these prac\-tical ques\-
tions. First, it requires a great deal of time, patience and resources to conduct a study 
that tracks abusive situa\-tions to a lethal or non-lethal outcome and that contains 
enough cases to analyze population groups at highest risk. This is because homi\-cide is 
such a rare event compared to abuse that may lead to homi\-cide. Second, though early 
identifi\-ca\-tion and ef\-fective inter\-ven\-tion must be built on a foundation of mul\-tiple public 
health and public safety data sources (Flewelling, 1994; Rosenfeld & Deck\-er, 1993; 
Hofford & Harrell, 1993:11), a controlled ex\-per\-i\-ment or case-control study can analyze 
only a limited number of variables simul\-ta\-neously.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Despite these methodological challenges, this kind of information is vitally impor\-
tant to health care providers, domestic violence advocates, and other helping 
profession\-als, so that they can alert women to warning signs for homicide in abusive 
relationships (Campbell, 1995, 1992; Geffner & Pagelow, 1990; Hart, 1988; Walker, 
1983). However, a reli\-able and validated profile of high-risk fac\-tors for a lethal outcome 
in intimate violence has not been avail\-able to them. Geffner and Pagelow (1990; Jaffe 
and Geffner, 1998), Hart (1988), and Sonkin, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1985: 80-83) were based on clinical 
ex\-per\-ience. Straus (1991) was based on a sample sur\-\-vey. None of these was 
psychometrically tested. The reliability and the discriminant and construct validity of the 
Index of Spouse Abuse (Hudson and McIntosh, 1981) and the Abusive Behavior 
Inventory (Shepard & Campbell, 1992) have been evalua\-ted, but the predictive value 
for serious injury has not been investigated. The relia\-bil\-i\-ty and con\-tent valid\-ity of 
Campbell's (1986) Danger Assess\-ment have been mea\-sured, but before the CWHRS, 
it had not been validated by a longi\-tudi\-nal analysis of lethal and non-lethal cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Three things are necessary to develop such a profile. First, it must be based on 
information com\-paring cases that escalate to a fatal out\-come to cases that do not 
(}{\plain \i\f1 lethal vs. non-lethal}{\plain \f1 ). Previous studies and instru\-ments differen\-ti\-ated between abused 
and non-abused women (for example, Leonard & Senchak, 1996), or men who 
physically attack their partners and men who do not (Saunders, 1995), but not 
necessari\-ly between abused women at risk of a fatal out\-come and other abused 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Second, profiles should be based on }{\plain \i\f1 longitudinal}{\plain \f1  information (Morley & 
Mullender, 1994; Lloyd, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 ,1993). Effective inter\-ven\-tions must take into account not 
just a single event or cir\-cum\-stance, but changing events over time. Intimate vio\-lence is 
seldom a single event, but rather a series of events that may increase or de\-crease in 
severity, a con\-tinuing relation\-ship punctua\-ted by verbal and physical abuse (Lloyd, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al.}{\plain \f1 ,1993; Giles-Sims, 1983; Goetting, 1989). Em\-pir\-ical evidence (Saltzman, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 ,1990; 
Johnson, 1995; Block, 1987b) indi\-cates that pre\-vious events cumu\-late to de\-ter\-mine the 
devel\-opment of each suc\-ceeding event. Because escalation is not inevi\-table, however 
(Feld & Straus, 1988; Bowker, 1993, 1984; Johnson, 1995, 1998), we must compare 
cases in which women successfully stop the violence in abusive situa\-tion to cases with 
a fatal outcome.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Third, an effective profile must be based on }{\plain \i\f1 multi-disciplinary}{\plain \f1  information. 
Though inti\-mate violence interventions exist in many settings - criminal justice (BJA, 
1992), hospital (Warshaw, 1992; Sheridan & Taylor, 1993) or clinic - it is increasingly 
clear that the effect of an inter\-ven\-tion in one setting may depend on coordina\-tion with 
inter\-ven\-tions in another (BJA, 1992:3; Hawkins, 1993; Fagan, 1993). There are many 
reasons for this (United Way, 1992:87-91), but a signifi\-cant obsta\-cle to col\-la\-bo\-ration is 
limited informa\-tion on inter\-active effects of the events, circum\-stances and interven\-tions 
that together produce the eventual outcome. Risk factors such as pregnancy, stalking, 
escalation of violence, ter\-min\-ating the rela\-tion\-ship, weapon availability, his suicide 
threat or his control\-ling behavior, and inter\-ven\-tions such as arrest, shelter or orders of 
protection, change over time and interact with each other. Roth (1994:6) puts it well:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720\sl1 
{\plain \f1 It is important for prevention purposes to view a violent event as the 
outcome of a long chain of preceding events, which might have been 
broken at any of several links, rather than as the product of a set of 
factors that can be ranked in order of importance.\par
}\pard \sl1 
{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS responded to the increasing need for informa\-tion to build public 
health and public safety strate\-gies to identify and effec\-tively intervene in poten\-tially life-threat\-en\-ing intimate vio\-lence situa\-tions, and the need for information to support field-level staff (clinicians, beat officers, community health educators, and so on) in their 
decisions as they encounter intimate vio\-lence situations. It collected the information 
necessary to develop a reli\-able, validated profile of high-risk fac\-tors for a lethal outcome 
in intimate violence, based on analysis of multi-disciplinary, longitudinal information 
linking non\--lethal and lethal cases of intimate violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 GOALS and OBJECTIVES}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The focus of the Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study (CWHRS) was to examine 
risk fac\-tors that would place a physically abused woman or her partner in immediate 
danger of death or life-threatening injury. }{\plain \f1 Immediate}{\plain \f1  was defined as within a year. 
Serious injury was included, be\-cause the outcome of an injury of a given severity may 
be deter\-mined by many factors, such as how long it takes for the victim to receive 
medical care (Kington & Smith, 1997; Dove, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1980; Maull, 1987), and because the 
avail\-ability of medical care may be related to race or social status (Woolhandler, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 
1985). The CWHRS did not ignore other negative out\-comes, such as sui\-cide or attacks 
on chil\-dren. However, the pri\-mary focus was to identi\-fy factors that are more likely to be 
present in abusive situations and relationships in which life-threatening injury or death 
will be an outcome in the next year, versus situations in which the woman and her 
partner escape uninjured, for whatever reason.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab These factors may differ for women within different ra\-cial/ethnic groups 
(Hawkins, 1985; 1993). Studies repeat\-ed\-\-ly find that the risk of in\-ti\-mate homicide is high 
for African/Ameri\-can/Blacks, in Chicago (Zimring, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1983: 922-923; Block, 1985, 
1987b, 1993) and national\-ly (Wilson & Daly, 1992; Kellermann & Mer\-cy, 1992; Dobash, 
}{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1989). In addition, the characteris\-tics of intimate homicide are not always the 
same for African/American/Black women, Latina/Hispanic women, or white non-Latina 
women (Block & Christakos, 1995). For exam\-ple, the risk of being killed by an intimate 
part\-ner in 1990 in Chicago was 5.7 per 100,000 for African/American/Blacks, 1.1 for 
Latino/Hispanics and 0.4 for whites or others.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1  Source: Chicago Homicide Dataset, annual\-ized 1990-1992 data; Block & Block, 1993.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Never\-the\-less, previous research paid 
little atten\-tion to identify\-ing high-risk situa\-tions or effective interven\-tions that may be 
specific to a particular racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another goal of the CWHRS was that our sample of women would not exclude 
women who might be called unknown or \'93hidden\'94 victims of intimate violence. These 
were defined as women who were being physically abused, but the abuse was 
unknown to any helping agency. (The woman might have been in contact with a helping 
agency, but that agency did not recognize or respond to her abuse.) Because women 
who seek help or receive intervention may differ greatly from women who do not, the 
results of studies based only on agency populations may not be applicable to all 
abused women. Studies of opiate addicts, for example, another hidden group, have 
found marked differences between institutional and untreated community populations 
(for a review, see Watters and Biernacki, 1989:417).}{\plain \f1  By definition, these women are 
extremely dif\-fi\-cult to sample (Life Span, 1994). They may appear in offi\-cial records only 
when they or their partner are in the morgue or emergency room. However, they may 
be one of the highest-risk groups for the death of either the man (Browne, 1986) or the 
woman. Langan (1986) found that National Crime Survey domestic violence vic\-tims 
who did not call the police were more likely to become re\-peat vic\-tims.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the CWHRS was primarily concerned with situations in which a 
woman was being physically abused by her intimate partner, whomever even\-tually dies. 
Specifically, though we recog\-nize the existence of inci\-dents in which a man is being 
physically abused by a woman intimate partner, previous abuse of the man partner was 
not the study's focus. Instead, our goal was to examine the risk of death or serious 
injury of either partner in situations in which the woman was being physically abused.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Previous research, mostly anecdot\-al, had indi\-cated that an out\-come of physical 
abuse against a woman can be the death of either partner (Browne, 1986; Dobash, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al.}{\plain \f1 , 1992; Wilson & Daly, 1992), but little was known about risk patterns in these situa\-
tions. Berk, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 's (1983) analysis, sug\-gesting that the woman's use of a lethal weapon 
may be defensive, not "mutual vio\-lence," agrees with state-level corre\-la\-tional evi\-dence 
(Browne & Williams, 1989) that avail\-ability of support ser\-vices for abused women is 
nega\-tively related to the risk of men being killed in domestic violence, and with Browne 
(1986), who compared battered women in prison for killing or attempting to kill the 
batterer to battered women who had not attempted to or killed the batterer, and found 
that the women who had killed or attempted to kill were less likely to have sought or 
received support.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Initial CWHRS goals and objectives, therefore, were the following 1) explore 
factors that indicate a high risk of serious injury or death of either partner within a year, 
in cases where a woman is being physically abused by her intimate partner; 2) 
determine whether or not patterns of high risk are different for abused women in 
different racial or ethnic groups (African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic and white or 
other); 3) include in the sample \'93hidden women\'94 who might be at high risk but their 
abuse is are not known to any helping agency; 4) sample at points of agency contact 
and focus data collection on information available to helping agencies, so that the 
results of the study would be useful for agencies making practical decisions; 5) 
determine whether the factors related to the death of the man partner differ from factors 
related to the death of the woman partner; 6) explore the interactive effects of clusters 
of risk factors on the risk of a lethal outcome, as they change over time; 7) take into 
account not only events and circum\-stances in the home or relationship, but also 
interven\-tions attempted by the woman's support network, medical, public health or 
helping agencies or criminal justice; and produce products aimed at practical use, such 
as a blueprint for educational material that is culturally sensitive to all of our 
communities.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Questions Explored} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study (CWHRS) was based on a comparison 
of abused women with and without a lethal outcome, taking into account the interaction 
of numerous events, circumstances and intervention attempts occurring over a year. 
For example, the analysis addresses situations in which interven\-tions were tried, but in 
which the woman was still seriously injured or killed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It was not possible to determine the indepen\-dent and interactive effects of all 
possible com\-bina\-tions of the many risk factors, strengths and protective factors, and 
interven\-tions in a woman\'92s life. Further, since much of the research relating to lethal 
outcome is anecdotal or circum\-stantial, and since there is very little multi-variate 
research available distinguishing cases of more and less serious abuse, we did not 
develop a specific hypothesis for every situational possibility. However, we expected, 
based on the available literature, that a number of risk factors, strengths and protective 
factors, and inter\-ventions would be related to the risk of a lethal outcome.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The project's analysis had two goals for these risk factors and interventions: first 
to determine the most important factors leading to a high risk of lethal outcome for each 
of three racial/ethnic groups (African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic and white or 
other), and second to explore their relationship case-by-case in more qualitative 
analysis. The second goal was made possible by the collection of detailed information 
about a wide variety of variables over a two-year time span.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Risk Factors} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The following section reviews the literature on risk factors, as it applies to the 
CWHRS perspective and focus. Much of the research on causes of intimate partner 
violence focuses on factors that might predict that a man will become violent or that a 
woman will become the target of violence in an intimate relationship. There were two 
important differen\-ces between this research tradition and the CWHRS approach. The 
primary difference was that factors predicting abuse may not predict life-threatening 
violence or death for a particular woman who is currently being abused by an intimate 
partner. The CWHRS focused specifically on factors that might be related to these 
extreme outcomes.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A second important difference was that the CWHRS considered the situation 
from the woman\'92s perspective. Our key question was this: what can a woman in the 
tremen\-dous\-ly difficult situation of intimate partner violence do to prevent death, and 
how can helping professionals assist her? Therefore, the CWHRS focused on the whole 
situation, changing over time, from the woman\'92s perspective. One result of this focus, 
for example, was that the CWHRS gathered data on the abusing partner or partners 
only as they interacted with the woman. We were very interested in the women 
themselves, how they coped over the two-year period of the study, what resources they 
brought to bear, and whether they managed to survive.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 History of Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab That vio\-lent\- behavior, whether within the intimate relation\-ship or outside it, in\-
creases the risk of death due to vio\-lence is a basic tenet of inti\-mate violence research. 
The majority of women who are victims of homicide or attempted homicide were 
violently attacked in the past by the partner who eventually killed them, with the 
percentage of prior violence ranging from 66% to 70% (Sharps, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Morocco, 
}{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998; Campbell, 1992). The Kellermann, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1993:1087; Bailey, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997) 
case control study found that a history of physical fights in the home is strongly 
associat\-ed with residen\-tial homicide. The }{\plain \i\f1 Vio\-lence against Women}{\plain \f1  survey found that 
frequent intimate assault was related to more serious attacks (John\-son, 1995). In 
Browne (1986), mur\-dered male partners had more prior arrests than men who were 
batterers who were not murdered.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, defi\-n\-i\-tions of vio\-lence and escala\-\-tion in these studies vary widely. 
Studies may define levels of violence by incident frequency, seri\-ous\-ness (inju\-ry), type 
and included aspects (during pregnan\-cy, sex\-ual violence, threats to children), or 
combinations of these. Measurements also vary (official records versus victim 
interviews).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Stalking and Other Harass\-ment} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Sheridan (1992) defines harass\-ment as, "a persistent pat\-tern of behavior by a 
male intimate partner that is in\-tended to bother, annoy, trap, emo\-tionally wear down, 
threaten, frighten, and/or terrify the woman in order to control her behav\-ior," and 
includes stalking; pet killing; threats of sexual abuse; de\-struction of her property; 
frequent unwanted tele\-phone calls; and threats of harm. Harassment may be a pre\-
cursor of death of the woman (Camp\-bell, 1992; Wilson & Daly, 1995) or of the man 
(Browne, 1986, 1987; Ew\-ing, 1987; Gillespie, 1989). Moracco, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1998) found that 
23.4% of North Carolina men who killed their intimate partner had previously stalked 
her.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Controlling Behavior} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many studies find that his assertion of power and control over her is an important 
motive for violence (Dutton & Browning, 1987, 1988; Mason & Blankenship, 1987; 
Wilson & Daly, 1995; Dobash & Dobash, 1995). Homicide may be a con\-sequence of 
using threat of homicide as a con\-trol mechanism (Wilson & Daly, 1995). In Canada 
(John\-son, 1995), "control\-ling and emotion\-ally abusive behaviors were used with much 
greater frequency by men who in\-flicted serious vio\-lence on their wives."\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Control\-ling behavior may underlie or inter\-act with other risk factors, and mediate 
the effect of inter\-ven\-tions. Fagan (1992: 192; citing Dunford, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 ,1990 and Ford, 
1991), argues that formal in\-ter\-ven\-tions work best when they, "correct power imbalances 
within intimate relation\-ships." The partner\'92s controlling behavior may cause the woman 
to become isolated from sources of support and assistance (Johnson, 1998; Kelly, 
1996: 79).\par
{\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Type of Union} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It is a common argument among anthropologists and social researchers (Ellis, 
1989; Ellis & DeKeseredy, 1989; Baumgartner, 1993) that women in a commonlaw 
relation\-ship are more at risk of abuse and less able to escape an abusive situation than 
women in a relationship sanctioned by marriage. Marriage provides \'93sanctions and 
sanctuary\'94 (Counts, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1992) -- guardians and support for the couple and 
surveillance and control for a potentially violent man. In addition, Ellis and DeKeseredy 
(1989) argue that lovers and ex-partners, as opposed to husbands, are less likely to be 
deterred from violence because they have a lower stake in conformity and are more 
likely to have a violent history. Research (NIJ, 1999; Wilson & Daly, 1995; Daly & Wil\-
son, 1988; Silverman & Mukherjee, 1987) has found that a couple's legal status 
(married, separated, di\-vorced, com\-mon\-law, boy\-friend/girlfriend) and whether they 
reside together are associated with the likelihood of death or serious injury in intimate 
vio\-lence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the couple\'92s ages (Wilson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Dumas & Per\'f3n, 1992) and the 
presence of children or stepchildren (Wilson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Daly }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993) may 
confound the apparent effect of type of union. In addition, the meaning of marriage for 
the couple and the effect of marriage on sanctions and sanctuary may not be the same 
for women in all cultural traditions. Therefore, the CWHRS was designed to examine 
the effect of type of union in conjunction with age, children and other factors, as well as 
to look at type of union in a cross-cultural perspective, for African/American/Black, 
Latina/Hispanic, as well as white or other women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Estrangement; Leaving the Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Two fundamental mis\-con\-cep\-tions are inherent in the popular question, "Why 
don't women just leave?" First, leaving is not a single action but a cumulative pro\-cess 
(Ferraro & John\-son, 1983; Landen\-burger, 1988, 1989; Walker, 1984; May, 1990), that 
may require a woman to leave an average of five times (Okun, 1986: 198), and take an 
average of eight years (Horton & Johnson, 1993). Second, if the woman leaves or 
threat\-ens to leave, her risk of being killed may increase (Dawson & Gartner, 1998; Wilt, 
}{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Wilson & Daly, 1993; Camp\-bell, 1992; Wallace, 1986). In Canada 
(Johnson, 1995), abuse in\-creased after separa\-tion in 36% of serious violence cases 
and 43% of less serious violence cases. The evolving process of termina\-tion is closely 
related to many other factors in the situa\-tion \_ harass\-ment or stalking before and after 
the attempt, escalat\-ing vio\-lence, his attempt to maintain control, official inter\-ven\-tions 
(arrest, orders of protec\-tion), formal or infor\-mal support avail\-ability \_ as well as to posi\-
tive (successful escape from the problem) and nega\-tive (being pursued and killed) 
outcomes.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Canadian }{\plain \i\f1 Violence against Women}{\plain \f1  survey (John\-son, 1992) and its U.S. re\-
pli\-cation (Tjaden, 1994) pro\-vide epi\-dem\-io\-log\-i\-cal data relating estrange\-ment to in\-
creased vio\-lence, but there is "little quantitative informa\-tion avail\-able" on estrange\-ment 
and homicide (Wilson & Daly, 1993).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Age and Age Disparity} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the }{\plain \i\f1 Violence against Women}{\plain \f1  survey (Johnson, 1995), both victim's and 
partner's ages predict vio\-lent victimization by a current spouse, with the risk at age 
group 18 to 24 three times the next highest age group. In a review of research, Wilson 
and Daly (1992:200-201) confirm this. They find indepen\-dent age effects for vic\-tim and 
offender, and an increase in violence with age dis\-parity. The Canadian }{\plain \i\f1 Violence against 
Women}{\plain \f1  survey did not confirm the age disparity effect, however.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Children} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The presence of children may have an effect on the likelihood of violence, on the 
severity of that violence, and on the likelihood that violence will continue. It may be 
more difficult for a woman to escape an abusive situation when she has had children 
with her intimate partner. Even though the relationship may have ended, she may still 
interact with her former partner because he is the father of her children. Visitation 
issues, child support and child custody disputes provide grounds for conflict, and may 
necessi\-tate continuing contact with the former partner (Jaffe & Geffner, 1998: 371-408; 
Pearson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1999). On the other hand, the presence of children may become part of 
the reason for a woman to leave the situation. Advocates often cite \'93fear for her 
children\'94 as the \'93last straw\'94 in motivating a woman to leave.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Data worldwide indicate that the pres\-ence of chil\-dren who were not sired by the 
woman\'92s current partner (his step\-chil\-dren) can preci\-pi\-tate intimate partner violence and 
homicide against the woman (Brewer, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997; Daly, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997; Daly & Wilson, 
1996; Wilson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Daly, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993; Wilson & Daly, 1992; Daly & Wilson, 
1988). Step\-children are over-represented among children killed by their \'93father,\'94 and 
are especially over-represented among children killed along with their mother (Daly, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997; Wilson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995:281-282; Daly, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993). The presence of children in 
the home is also related to homi\-cide of the man (Brown, 1986).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the effect that the presence of children may have on the violence, a 
growing body of research shows that violence in the home may have an effect on 
children (Holden, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998; Margolin, 1998; Margolin & John, 1997; Kolbo, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 
1996; Henning, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996). Nationally, it is estimated that at least 4 million children a 
year are exposed to battering and domestic violence in their home. In a recent study of 
domestic violence screening in a pediatric emergency department (Duffy, 1999), more 
than half of battered mothers reported being concerned that their children were affected 
by having witnessed domestic violence. These children are at risk for being injured both 
as a co-victim with their parent and by child abuse (which is markedly increased in 
homes with domestic violence). In addition, there are many traumatic effects when one 
parent kills another (Hendriks, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993). Campbell (1995) found that, in 57 intimate 
partner homicide cases, there were 12 children under age 15 who had witnessed the 
murder of their mother or found their mother\'92s body.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Physical and Mental Health} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many studies find a strong relationship between a woman suffering intimate 
partner violence and her physical health (Sharps, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Plichta, 1997). The 
cause-and-effect can run both ways. A physically abused woman often incurs a 
physical or mental health problem as a result of the abuse (McCauley, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; 
Zachariades, et al., 1990; Grisso, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1991). At the same time, a medical problem or 
condition such as pregnancy may make a woman more vulnerable to abuse (Stark & 
Flitcraft, 1996). The causal relationship between abuse and health is, therefore, 
complex, and can be untangled only through a longitudinal study.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There is an increasing body of research that links mental health problems, 
espec\-ially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, to violent victimization 
(Kilpatrick, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998) and specifically, to intimate partner violence (Saunders, 1992, 
1994; Graham-Berman & Levendosky, 1998; Campbell, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1995; Schole, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 
1998; Cascardi & O\'92Leary, 1992; Sato & Heiby, 1992). Thompson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , (1999) found 
that \'93physical partner abuse, but not nonphysical partner abuse, was associated with an 
increased risk for PTSD.\'94}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another complicating factor in the measurement of physical and mental 
outcomes of intimate partner violence is that the severity of any single incident does not 
necessarily indicate the overall severity of the violence being experienced by the 
woman. Most medical visits by abused women do not involve trauma resulting from the 
abuse (Scholle, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1998). That is one of the main reasons for universal screening in 
health care settings, as opposed to screening only women presenting with trauma 
(Stark & Flitcraft, 1991: 140).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Pregnancy} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Trauma is the leading cause of maternal death in the Chicago area; the majority 
of these deaths are homi\-cide (Fildes, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1992), but little is known about homicide 
risk during or shortly after pregnancy, except for the ground-breaking research of Judith 
McFarlane and her colleagues (Wiist & McFarlane, 1998a; McFarlane, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1992, 
1996 1998; Parker, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1994; Helton, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1988). There is also evidence that 
pregnancy is related to abuse severity and thus to homicide risk. In Canada, 33% of 
severe\-ly abused women were battered during pregnancy, compared to 8% of less 
severely abused women; in 40% the abuse began during pregnancy (John\-son, 1995). 
Of pregnant women, adults are more severely abused than teens and white women are 
more at risk of homi\-cide (McFarlane, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1992).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A number of studies access the presence of risk factors for domestic violence 
among pregnant women, such as a woman\'92s alcohol use and her partner\'92s drug use 
(Amaro, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1990), her age (Gelles, 1988), the partner\'92s controlling behavior 
(Campbell, 1992), the weapon used (McFarlane, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998), pregnancy intendedness 
(Gazmararian, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995) and neighborhood characteristics (O\'92Campo, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995). 
In addition, understanding the timing of abuse may be a key to prevention (Hillard, 
1985; Helton, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1988; Gelles, 1988; McFarlane, 1989; Campbell, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1989). 
Does the violence precede the pregnancy, begin with the pregnancy, or begin after the 
baby is born?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Intervention at pregnancy, whether it originates in a health care setting; 
(Saltzman, 1990; Sharps, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Sheridan, 1996) or in law enforcement 
(Campbell, 1992; Wiist & McFarlane, 1998b), has obvious impor\-tance not only for the 
woman but for her child (Bullock & McFarlane, 1989; Dietz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Newberger, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al}{\plain \f1 ., 1992). But pregnant women may be less likely than other women to seek help in 
either setting. Since abused women are late in seeking pre\-natal care (Parker, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 
1994; Dietz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997), many "unknown" battered women may be pregnant.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Alcohol or Drug Abuse} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There is ample evidence that intoxication is common in intimate partner homicide 
offenders, whichever partner is killed. About 40% of murder offenders report that they 
had been drinking at the time of the offense, and of these, 90% had a blood alcohol 
level .05 or higher (Greenfield, 1998). Research is less clear about drug use and 
intimate partner homicide, but both drinking problems and illicit drug use by the victim or 
any member of the house\-hold were \'93highly predictive of fatal domestic violence\'94 in a 
case control study of femicide in the home (Bailey, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  1997:781; Rivara, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1997).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research also points to the victim\'92s alcohol or drug use. For women victims, a 
New Mexico study of 134 femicide victims found that 54% (domestic violence) and 69% 
(other) had drugs or alcohol in their blood (Arbuckle, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1996). For men homicide 
victims, Browne (1986; 1987), Block and Christakos (1995), Smith, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1998), and 
others have found an association between intimate homicide of a man and his alcohol 
use. Previous analysis of the Chicago Homicide Dataset has found that alcohol was 
more likely to be a factor when a woman killed her partner than when a man killed his 
partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are many avenues connecting substance abuse and intimate partner 
violence, in addition to pharmacological effects such as disinhibition. First, substance 
abuse may be the subject of conflict (Kantor & Straus, 1989; Brewer, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1998:112; 
Miller, 1990). In an earlier Chicago homicide, for example, an addict killed his partner 
because she had \'93squandered\'94 her check on baby food rather than giving it to him for 
drugs. Drinking or drug abuse may be means of exerting power and control. Second, 
the abuser may attempt to force the woman to assist in drug dealing, or to prostitute 
herself in order to pay for drugs, activities that would put her at greater risk of violent 
death (Grant & Campbell, 1998). Third, the abuser may force her to use alcohol or 
drugs. In Brookoff\'92s (1997) Memphis study, about 42% of the victims had used alcohol 
or drugs on the day of the assault, and 15% had used cocaine. However, about half of 
those who had used cocaine said that their assailant had forced them to use it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Underlying causes include an association between childhood abuse and alcohol\-
ism, which, coupled with the association of each of these with adult abuse victimiza\-tion, 
produces a complex set of circumstances that may be difficult to unravel (Miller, 1999: 
196-199; Windle, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1995; Grant & Campbell, 1998.) Other factors include social 
status (Fagan, 1993) and race/ethnicity (Kantor, 1997). Jasinski, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1997) found that 
ethnicity and work-related stress have an interactive effect on battering. Lillie-Blanton, 
}{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1991) found that African/American/Black women were more likely to be 
nondrinkers and less likely to be heavy drinkers, than white women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are numerous differences between patterns of alcohol and drug abuse in 
men and women (for a review, see Lex, 1991), and the relationship between a woman\'92s 
abuse of alcohol or drugs and being battered by her partner is not clear. Although 
\'93wife\'92s drunkenness\'94 is an important factor distinguishing abused from nonabused 
women, this is true only for minor violence, not severe violence (Kantor & Straus, 1989). 
Similarly, Brewer, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1998) found that women using crack, other cocaine or 
tranquilizers were more likely to be hit, slapped or shoved, but they did not measure 
more serious violence, and found that the woman\'92s alcohol use was not related to the 
likelihood of abuse.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In analysis of the 1985 Family Violence Survey, Kantor and Straus (1989) found 
that the husband\'92s drug use and his drunkenness were among the five most important 
variables that distinguished abused from nonabused women. In their study of pregnant 
women, Amaro and colleagues (1990) found that women who were victims of violence 
were more likely than nonvictims to have a male partner who was a marijuana or 
cocaine user. However, alcohol use was not a factor. In a Memphis study, Brookoff 
(1997) reported that 92% of assailants had used drugs or alcohol during the day of the 
assault, and 45% had been intoxicated daily for the past month. Coleman and Straus 
(1983) found that rates of violence were almost fifteen times as high for husbands who 
were \'93often\'94 versus \'93never\'94 drunk in the last year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The cultural context can be a contributing factor to the effect of a man\'92s alcohol 
abuse on his violence against women (Fagan, 1993; Johnson, 1997). Drinking in 
certain social contexts, such as bars, pubs and other men-only environments, may 
support norms of violence against women (Schwartz & DeKeseredy, 1997).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Suicide Attempts or Threats} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Partner\'92s Suicide as a Risk Factor for Homicide} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Research indicates that the 
woman and child\-ren are at risk of being killed when a man commits suicide (Spungen, 
1998; Clark & Fawcett, 1992b; Crittenden & Crain, 1990; Block & Christokos, 1995; 
Rosenbaum, 1990; Block, 1987b; Daly & Wil\-son, 1988; Allen, 1983; West, 1966; 
Wolfgang, 1958). In Canada from 1974 to 1987, 31% of men who killed their wives and 
19% of men who killed their common\-law partner committed suicide (Johnson & 
Chisholm, 1989). In Albuquerque, New Mexico from 1978 to 1987, a third of the 36 
murders of \'93couples\'94 were homicide/suicides (Rosenbaum, 1990). In Chicago, Stack 
(1997) found that the chance of the offender committing suicide after homicide was 
increased 12.68 times after killing an ex-spouse or ex-lover, 10.28 times after killing a 
child, 8.00 times after killing a spouse, and 6.11 times after killing a girl\-friend or 
boyfriend, compared to only 1.88 times after killing a friend. This has clear implications 
for intervention, as Palmer and Humphrey (1980:106) found:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720\sl1 
{\plain \f1 . . . the killing of someone in close relationship to the offend\-er, often a 
wife, appeared to be part of the evolving process of suicide.\par
}\pard \sl1 
{\plain \f1 \tab In recognition of this research, a question on suicide threats or attempts is part of 
the Campbell Danger Assess\-ment. Howev\-er, previous studies did not explore the 
"evolving pro\-cess" of sui\-cide and homicide, and suicide }{\plain \i\f1 threat}{\plain \f1  was not addressed as a 
risk factor for the part\-ner's death. Such research is difficult, because homi\-cide/suicides 
are even more rare than homi\-cides. Of the 19,335 murders in Chicago from 1965 to 
1990, there were only 268 homi\-cide/suicides, 174 of them between inti\-mate part\-ners 
(Block, 1993).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Suicidal Feelings and the Risk of Homicide Victimization} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Though re\-search 
shows that women almost never commit sui\-cide after killing an intimate partner, sui\-cidal 
feelings may place her at risk of being killed herself; this has not been explored 
previously. There may be a corre\-la\-tion between a woman\'92s suicide and being abused 
by her partner (Stark & Flitcraft, 1996:99-121; Thompson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999). The causal 
relation\-ship may go in two directions. First, a woman who is depressed and suicidal 
may be at especially high risk for serious partner abuse. For example, she may be less 
able to withstand a partner\'92s control mechanisms or harassment, and less able to avail 
herself of sources of help. Second, a woman who is being abused may become 
seriously depressed (Sato & Heiby, 1992) and see no alternative to suicide (Saunders, 
1992:221). In a review of the literature, Stark and  Flitcraft (1991:123-157) found that\par
}\pard \li720\ri720\sl1 
{\plain \f1 . . . attempted suicide -- and particularly multiple attempts -- is a significant 
sequella of abuse among women, affecting one abused woman in ten. 
Conversely, abuse may be the single most important precipitant for 
female suicide attempts yet identified.\par
}\pard \sl1 
{\plain \f1 Thompson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1999) also found that \'93intimate partner violence is a significant risk 
factor for suicidal behavior among women.\'94 The same study also found, however, that 
her suicide attempts were associated with partner violence only when the woman had 
PTSD symptoms.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Firearm Availability} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Considerable research (Cook & Moore, 1994; DHHS, 1992: 190-193) sug\-gests 
that the likelihood of death in an expres\-sive assault is related to the availability of a 
wea\-pon. If used, a fire\-arm or knife is much more likely to result in death (Zimring, 
1972). The case control studies of Keller\-mann, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1993) and Bailey, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1997) 
found gun ownership was strongly related to residential homicide, and to violent death 
of women in the home. Mercy and Saltzman (1989) have reported that violence 
between intimate partners is 12 times as likely to be fatal if a firearm is involved.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab But the causal direction is not clear: Do violent house\-holds have firearms, or 
does the presence of a firearm in the home lead to more lethal violence?\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Strengths and Protective Factors} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It is important to realize that, contrary to popular belief, most abused women are 
not passive recipients of violence, but are \'93actively engaged in seeking the assistance 
of outsiders\'94 to end the violence (Johnson, 1998:63-71). However, every woman is not 
able to stop the violence in an abusive situation. A woman\'92s ability to do so may 
depend, in part, on the resources she has at her disposal, including both material 
resources and a network of social support and informal assistance (Bowker, 1994; 
Horton & Johnson, 1993). Holly Johnson (1998) found that an abused woman\'92s 
isolation was a major factor in the cessation of violence against her. Further, Browne 
(1997) and Campbell, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1994) point out that women who may not yet have 
succeeded in stopping the violence against her are still \'93actively engaged in surviving\'94 
(Johnson, 1998:63).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Social Support/ Helping Network} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though many researchers comment that informal intervention and social support 
are tremendously important to a woman\'92s ability to deal with violence in her life, there 
has been little research that operationalizes and measures the effect of different kinds 
of social support, in relationship to other risk factors and formal interventions. One 
purpose of the CWHRS was to remedy this situation by collecting longitudinal data on 
multiple types of support and intervention, from the woman\'92s perspective. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Like the availability of formal support agencies, the strength of the informal social 
support network has been found to be negatively related to woman-to-man intimate 
violence (Barnett, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996). In a longitudinal study of women leaving a shelter, 
Alcorn (1984: v) found that "natural helping net\-works, service pro\-viders and enforced 
laws [interactively sup\-port] battered women's attempts to prevent further inci\-dents of 
vio\-lence." A helping network (Mitchell & Hurley, 1981) can pro\-vide both material support 
and an "external definition of the relation\-ship" that may trigger an abused woman's 
"aware\-ness of danger" (Ferraro & Johnson, 1983:333) and convey shame to a batterer 
(Fagan, 1993). As a result, perhaps, the availability of social support seems to be 
negatively related to self-blame in battered women (Barnett, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Income, Education, and Employ\-ment} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to social support resources, a woman\'92s material resources may make 
a difference in her ability to stop the violence. For example, a personal income that she 
controls herself and an education that makes her marketable may give her more 
alternatives. Employment outside the home brings her into contact with the outside 
world and may provide easier access to helping agencies and friends (Johnson, 1998; 
Eckberg, 1995).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The correlation sometimes found between race or ethnicity and intimate partner 
violence may be due to unequal access to these resources across communities. In a 
study of people\'92s ability to function with a chronic disease, for example, Kington and 
Smith (1997) demonstrated that poorer functioning for African/American/Blacks and 
Latino/Hispanics was completely explained by education, income and wealth.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, low income and unemployment may be related to the likelihood that 
the woman\'92s partner will be violent towards her. In a study focusing specifically on 
causes of violence in the African/American/Black community, Sampson (1987) found 
that income and employ\-ment were factors. In the Canadian Violence Against Women 
survey, men who were unemployed in the year prior to the survey assaulted their wives 
at twice the rate as employed men (Johnson, 1995).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Profiles of high-risk situations will not prevent violent death, unless they lead to 
an effec\-tive intervention. However, intervention from a public health, public safety or 
helping agen\-\-cy may not be suf\-ficient or even necessary for a woman to escape a 
danger\-ous situa\-tion (Dobash, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1985; Bowker, 1983). For\-mal interven\-tions occur in 
a con\-text of interven\-tions ini\-tiated by the woman herself with the support of natural 
helping net\-works. An abused woman\'92s ability to \'93mobilize social control\'94 effectively 
(Johnson, 1998: 63-74) is an interactive process related to her resources as well as to 
the availability of services. Therefore, an assess\-ment of the use and effect of 
interventions must begin by assessing the woman\'92s avenues of support -- the resources 
she calls on, the situations under which she seeks help or does not seek help, the help 
she receives (from her perspective), and whether or not she considers that help to have 
been useful.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab From the point of view of helping agencies and organizations, women who are 
being victimized by violence pose unique problems. Battered women are not only a 
\'93challenge to the medical model\'94 (Warshaw, 1989; Life Span, 1994), but a challenge to 
tradi\-tional law en\-force\-ment (BJA, 1992: 2; Mederer & Gelles, 1989; Gondolf & 
McFerron, 1989).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Health Care} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  Partner violence is the leading cause of injury for which women seek medical 
atten\-tion. Women injured by their intimate partner\'92s violent attack frequently seek help 
from hospital emergency departments (Sharps, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Dearwater, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998; 
Abbott, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Goldberg & Tomlanovich, 1985) and from other sources of medical 
care (Plichta, 1992; Rath, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1989). For example, 17% of women visiting an emer\-
gency room for treat\-ment came because of being injured by an intimate partner 
(Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1997). Stark (1984) estimates that if a woman presents for 
health care three times with injuries, she has an 80% likelihood of being a battered 
woman.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Langford (1996) found that almost three-fourths of victims of homicide by a 
family member had been seen in a health care setting before the murder. However, 
women who seek health care may not be identified as a victim of abuse (Dearwater, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998). In response to this situation, many professional medical organizations, 
including the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology and the American Medical Association, advocate routine screening for 
domestic violence and work to educate health professionals to better identify women in 
battering relation\-ships. In order to include all of these women in the CWHRS 
clinic/hospital sample, the sample design was based on routine screening of every 
woman coming to a medical facility, for any kind of treat\-ment or care, not only treatment 
for violence.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Community Services} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Like health care facilities, agencies offering community services often neglect, 
ignore, or minimize the problem of physical abuse (O\'92Leary & Cascardi, 1998). 
However, Fagan (1993) found that arrest and pro\-se\-cu\-tion may be most effective (or 
effective only) in conjunc\-tion with a social support network, agency treat\-ment programs 
or other informal social control mech\-an\-isms. A goal of the CWHRS, therefore, was to 
capture the profile-year use of ser\-vices such as shelters, advo\-cates, counsel\-ing, bat\-
terer treatment, treatment programs in prison or pro\-ba\-tion (Tolman & Bhosley, 1991; 
Dobash & Dobash, 1995; BJA, 1993: 15-16), alcohol or drug treat\-ment, or suicide 
preven\-tion.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Alcohol Treatment or Counseling} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Holly Johnson (1997:18) found that, controlling for other factors, men who were 
regular heavy drinkers (five or more drinks at one time at least once per month) were 
more likely to continue to assault their wives. However, she argues that, even though 
many battered women have reported that the violence stopped following alcohol treat\-
ment for their partners, the situation is not clear. Because heavy drinking is often 
coupled with other factors that may be more important predictors of violence, it is 
difficult to say whether treatment for drinking alone will make a difference (Johnson, 
1996:225).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Police Intervention} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women may be reluctant to notify the police, for many reasons. They may fear 
retaliation from their partner; they may fear that their children will be taken away; they 
may fear that the police might arrest them. In a Canadian random sample of women, 
almost half of women who suffered frequent injurious violence and feared for they lives 
said that they had never called the police for help (Johnson, 1996). Older women, who 
were less likely to seek help from informal sources, were more likely to call the police 
(Johnson, 1998: 195-196).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Once the police have been notified, they are not always helpful. Randomized 
field ex\-periments (Sherman & Berk, 1984; Dunford, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1990; Sherman, 1992) have 
yielded complex and some\-times conflict\-ing information on the effect of arrest on sub\-se\-
quent intimate vio\-lence (see Fagan, 1993a, 1996; McCord, 1992 for reviews). Other 
research (Berk, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1980-81; Buzawa, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1992; Buzawa & Buzawa, 1996a; 
Ferraro, 1989; Lavoie, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1989; Stith, 1990) has found that responding police 
officers may not make an arrest, even when the victim has been severely injured, may 
allow the man to be present and in control during the interview, and may carry stereo\-
typical attitudes about battered women with them into the field.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Court Intervention; Orders of Protection} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It is neces\-sary to monitor and en\-force both protection orders and offender 
release conditions to ensure victim safety (BJA, 1992:3; Ptacek, 1997; Caringella-MacDonald, 1997). However, previous research was lacking on the inter\-action of court 
interven\-tions with other interventions and circum\-stances (Harrell & Smith, 1996; 
Buzawa & Buzawa, 1996b; Harrell, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993; Ford, 1991). Dobash and Dobash 
(1995) con\-cluded that court injunc\-\-tions are useful under some cir\-cum\-stances (see Finn, 
1991; Finn & Colson, 1990; Goolkasian, 1986; Grau, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1984), but found that their 
value would be enhanced by comparing injunc\-tions to "doing nothing or arresting the 
man."\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Sample surveys and experi\-ments or case-control studies provide a vast amount 
of infor\-mation about charac\-teristics of abused versus nonabused women and about 
non\--lethal escalation of abuse, but they do not link that information with a lethal 
outcome. It would take many years and tremendous resources to track a repre\-sen\-ta\-tive 
sample of abused women until the risk of a lethal outcome could be deter\-mined, 
especially a sample large enough to examine simul\-tan\-eous effects of numerous risk 
factors and interventions. The CWHRS used a quasi-experimental design (Cook & 
Campbell, 1979) to link abused women to possible lethal out\-comes, without the pro\-hibi\-
tive expense of a massive long-term study. The goal was to yield a maximum amount of 
infor\-ma\-tion in a reasonable time within a finite budget.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This design incorporated the following key aspects:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 1. The purpose of the CWHRS was not to provide population-based estimates of 
domestic violence in Chicago. Rather, the goal was to sample high-risk women at a 
point of service.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are many other studies measuring the risk of being abused in the general 
popu\-la\-tion (for example, the Canadian and United States Violence Against Women 
Surveys). There are also studies that follow abused women identified in shelter or other 
agency populations. These studies are relatively easy to do, because the agency 
records and agency setting provides access to women who are already identified as 
being abused. However, the results of these studies may not be generalizable to 
\'93hidden\'94 women, women who may be at high risk but who are not known to helping 
agencies (Watters & Biernacki, 1989:417).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 2. So that high-risk but understudied populations (expectant mothers, women 
with\-out a regular source of health care and abused women where the abuse is 
unknown to helping agencies) would be included in the CWHRS, we chose sample 
screening sites in areas of the city with a high rate of intimate partner homicide, and 
designed instruments and procedures to minimize selection bias.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 3. To produce valid results within racial/ethnic group (for African/American/Black 
women, Latina/Hispanic women, and white or other women), we had a large sample 
size and developed culturally sensitive instruments and methods.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 4. Respondent safety and confidentiality were primary considerations throughout 
the study. Ethical and safety concerns took priority over achieving research goals.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab These concerns can be summarized by the three ethical principles for human 
research,}{\plain \f1  Beneficence, Respect and Justice}{\plain \f1 , set forward in the Belmont Report 
(DHEW, 1978; Sieber, 1992:18). Beneficence means avoiding unnecessary harm while 
maximizing good outcomes for the research and for the participants. Respect means 
protecting autonomy with courtesy and respect. Justice means, among other things, 
that \'93those who bear the risks of the research should be those who benefit from it.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \f1 Project Methodology: Overview} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS design, shown graphically in Exhibit 1, had three major parts: 1) 
separ\-ate non\--lethal and lethal sam\-ples, the former targeting ser\-i\-ously abused women 
within three racial/ethnic groups (African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic and white or 
other), 2) both sam\-ples tracked for a year, and 3) similar data collected on each. The 
(initially) non-\-lethal sam\-ple, 497 women in abusive re\-la\-tion\-ships, were inter\-viewed 
about a retrospective calendar year and then tracked by a pro\-spec\-tive series of inter\-
views spanning a year from initial contact. The lethal sample, 87 women and men killed 
by intimate part\-ners in Chicago in 1995 or 1996, were tracked by retro\-spec\-tive inter\-\-
views with two know\-ledge\-able proxies (friend, rela\-tive, neigh\-bor) who can pro\-vide infor\-
ma\-tion on events occurring in the year before the homi\-cide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, we gathered calendar information on the lethal sample for one year prior to 
the attack that resulted in death, and on the non-lethal sample for a year before and a 
year after the event that led to inclusion in the sam\-ple (presen\-ta\-tion at hospi\-tal or 
clinic). When possi\-ble, we col\-lected the same informa\-tion and utilized the same in\-stru\-
ments with both sam\-ples, locating each risk factor or in\-ter\-ven\-tion on a profile year cal\-
en\-dar (Campbell, 1993), so that clusters of events, circumstances and interventions can 
be related tempor\-al\-ly to each other and to the outcome.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This design assumed that the couples represented by the lethal and non-lethal 
abused sam\-ples were comparable and that the profile year informa\-tion gathered retro\-
spec\-tively for the lethal cases could be compared to information gathered prospec\-tively 
for the non-lethal abused cases. A study in which lethal and non-lethal abused sam\-ples 
were the same people, one that followed a random sample of abused women for years 
to de\-ter\-mine the eventual outcome, would have necessitated a huge sample, presented 
correspon\-dingly huge finan\-cial and respondent safety obstacles, and required many 
years for results to be available for practical application. This is because intimate 
partner homicide is such a rare event in Chicago. Until such a study is feasi\-ble, the 
results of the CWHRS will provide information available nowhere else.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the CWHRS design included a comparison group of 208 nonabused 
women appearing in the same health care settings as the sampled abused women. 
While the focus of the study was to compare women at risk of a lethal outcome to other 
abused women, this non-abused comparison sam\-ple provided a context for the non-lethal abused sample. It con\-nected our results to the many studies that compare 
abused women to women in general, and provided information for clinic or hospital 
prac\-ti\-tio\-ners to use when designing interven\-tion strate\-gies for abused women. (It was 
inexpensive to add this comparison group to the study, since the informa\-tion was be 
gathered any\-way to screen abused from non\-abused women, and no follow-up 
interviews were necessary.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The key analytical comparisons are shown in Exhibit 1, above, by vertical 
dashed arrows. The most important comparison was between the lethal and the non-lethal samples of abused women. The goal of the high-risk profile analysis was to 
determine the configura\-tion of events, circumstances and interventions, occurring over 
a year, that distinguish these two groups. This analysis also included several sub-analyses, separate high-risk pro\-files for African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic, and 
white or other women; and a separate profile for pregnant women. In addition, we 
conducted a comparison of intimate homicide in same-sex relation\-ships versus 
heterosexual relationships, and a com\-pari\-son of heterosexual intimate homicides in 
which the woman versus the man died. The focal question for each comparison was to 
determine whether or not the groups differed enough so that separate analyses should 
be conducted of the configuration of profile-year events, circum\-stances and 
interventions surrounding the homicides.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In total, the CWHRS samples (Exhibit 2) included 792 subjects (497 abused, 208 
comparison and 87 murder victims). The initial interviews covered a retros\-pective year. 
Follow-up interviews, of the abused women only, covered a prospective year. To the 
extent possible, the same retrospective questions were asked of the proxy 
respondents. We interviewed as many as three proxy respondents per murder victim.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Major Tasks} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In order to implement the Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study design, a number 
of tasks were necessary. These are summarized in Exhibit 3.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Changes in Study Design} \tcl2}, Compared with the Original Proposal}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 1. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Inclusion of same-sex intimate partner relationships} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original CWHRS design sought to identify factors that place women abused 
by a male intimate partner (spouse, ex-spouse, commonlaw, boy\-friend, ex-boyfriend) in 
danger of life-threaten\-ing injury or death. However, after much discussion, the 
collabora\-tors in the Advisory Board decided to include same-sex relationships as well. 
Thus, the clinic and hospital sample became women who had been physically abused 
by an intimate partner, man or woman, in the past year. The lethal sample became any 
intimate partner death in 1995 or 1996, in which at least one of the partners was a 
woman.\par
}{\plain \f1 2. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Decision not to collect public record data (clinic/hospital sample)} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the original proposal, we responded to the NIJ review panel's concern about 
the unclear nature of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) collaboration, by deciding 
that the non-lethal data collection would be too demanding of CPD resources. The 
proposal called for the Authority, as the other criminal justice agency on the project 
team, to collect the criminal history and court record data. The continuing Chicago 
Homicide Project, and a collaborating agency, the Cook County Medical Examiner's 
Office, would be the source of proxy information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This procedure was followed for the proxy study. However, the Advisory Board 
decided early in the study, with NIJ approval, not to collect official record data on the 
clinic and hospital women or on their abuser. The collaborators on the Advisory Board 
felt strongly that it would be an undue invasion of the woman\'92s privacy to collect the 
information that would have been necessary in order to track her in official records 
(SSN, date of birth). In addition, the collaborators were concerned that an investigation 
of the woman and the abuser in official records, no matter how circumspect, might 
provide the occasion for a safety risk for the woman. Finally, the collaborators working 
in the Latino/Hispanic community were very worried that the inclusion of such questions 
in the questionnaire would frighten some women who were concerned about this 
information getting back to \'93the authorities.\'94 With this in mind, we eliminated many of 
these sensitive questions from the questionnaire.\par

of the sensitive nature of the questionnaire, and that it was this sensitive question\-naire

reduction of bias that might exclude especially high-risk women from the study.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Our original respondent fee schedule was $10 for the initial interview, $10 for the

difficulty in finding women for their follow-up interview, we raised the respondent fee to 
$20 for both follow-up interviews. This did appear to help. (See Gondolf, 1998, for a 
discussion of the ethical issues surrounding respondent fees.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original project design called for a total of $20,200 to be given to women in 
increments of $10 or $15 as a token of our appreciation for their help with the project, 
plus money for bus fare. However, the Illinois state fiscal people could not figure out 
how we could legally deal with this money. It was obviously too much to handle through 
petty cash, and it is illegal for a state agency to use a checking account to deal with it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Fortunately, the highly collaborative and cooperative nature of the project came 
to the rescue on this issue. Each of the four sites agreed to handle the incentive fees. 
The state sent them money as a vendor. They kept this money in an account, and 
provided $10 for the initial interview, and later $20 for the follow-up interview or $20 to 
each proxy respondent, to the interviewer or to the respondent directly. There was a 
system of receipts, each signed by the respondent, the interviewer and the site 
representa\-tive, for respondent fees paid from these accounts. In addition to the 
respondent fee itself, money from this fund was spent for related costs, including the 
respondent\'92s transportation to the interview, money order fees when we mailed the fee 
to the respondent at a safe address, stamps for mailings to safe addresses and safe 
contact people, and long distance telephone calls to respondents who lived out-of-state. 
This whole process was audited (see the budget for the audit report).\par
}{\plain \f1 4. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Decision to double the comparison group} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
\tab Early in data collection at the clinic and hospital sites, we realized that some 
women had been screened as non-abused (NAW), but told the interviewer about 
physical abuse in the past year. We reasoned that the short, rather impersonal three-question screener was not allowing some women the comfort they needed to divulge 
such sensitive information. We also reasoned that some of our high-priority women, 
those who are at high risk for serious or fatal abuse, yet are not known by any helping 
agency to be at risk, might very well be in this group. To increase the odds that we 
would not miss any of these women, we decided to double the number of complete 
interviews done with women who screened NAW. In the final analysis, there were 76 
women who screened NAW but who interviewed AW. This included 51 women 
screened as NAW but said they had been abused over a year ago and 25 who 
answered no to all three screening questions. Some of these 76 women, it turned out, 
had been severely abused in the previous year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original study design called for 600 interviews of abused women and 100 
interviews of non-abused women. The original plan was to interview every woman who 
screened abused, and to interview a random selection of non-abused women as time 
permitted, aiming for about one non-abused interview for every six interviews of an 
abused woman. Instead, we decided to interview at least two women screened as non-abused for every five screened as abused, or 500 interviews of abused women and 200 
comparison interviews. In the end, we interviewed 453 women screened as AW and 
237 women screened as NAW. {\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1  For 16 interviewed women, we do not know how they screened, because the screener is 
missing. In addition, one woman told us at follow-up that she had falsified the initial interview 
and the screener.}}}
}{\plain \f1 After the interview, the final sample contained 497 
women interviewed as AW and 208 women interviewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 5. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Decision to interview more than one proxy respondent} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The \'93soul\'94 of this project is the comparison of situations of intimate violence that 
did and did not end in serious injury or death to one of the partners, in other words, the 
comparison of lethal to non-lethal. To the extent possible, the same interview 
instrument was used for both samples, with proxies (people who are knowledgeable 
about the situations of the women and men who died) being interviewed for the \'93lethal\'94 
sample.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original proposal to NIJ included money for two proxy interviews, but the 
project as funded did not include money for the second proxy. However, the Advisory 
Board members strongly recommended to NIJ that the project receive a supplemental 
grant to cover a second proxy. This money was approved, and the proxy study 
methodol\-ogy was changed to include a provision for two proxy interviews where 
possible.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Advisory Board based this strong recommendation on a series of delibera\-
tions over several meetings. At one of these meetings, the board consulted with Prof. 
David C. Clark, who conducted a large-scale study of suicide victims in collaboration 
with the Cook County Medical Examiner\'92s Office, using \'93psychological autopsy\'94 
methods (proxy respondents). Although the results of the three-year study were not yet 
available for general publication at the August 30, 1997 meeting, Dr. Clark stressed 
repeatedly the importance of multiple proxy interviews. In his research (Clark & Horton-Deutsch, 1992a; Clark & Fawcett, 1992b), he interviewed as many as seven proxies per 
subject, and found that different confidants of the suicide victim have different 
perspectives and contribute unique, valuable information for the study. In David Clark's 
experience, new information is often gained from the sixth or seventh interviewed 
person.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Based on Dr. Clark\'92s advice, the board had two serious concerns about the 
validity of a single proxy interview. First, different proxies will be knowledge\-able about 
different aspects of the victim's situation prior to the murder. We cannot expect a single 
proxy, even someone who is very close to the victim, to know as much as two or three 
proxies. Second, the Board was concerned about proxy bias. For example, if a man is 
murdered by his wife after years of his abuse, would a proxy interview with the man\'92s 
best friend provide complete information about the abuse of his wife prior to the homi\-
cide? While the Board recognized that we could not expect a close confidant of a 
murdered person to be an entirely objective witness, it decided that interviewing at least 
two proxies would help to measure and control for proxy bias. Therefore, the Board 
decided that it would be a high priority to seek supplemental funding that would allow 
the study to include two proxies per subject.\par
}{\plain \f1 6. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Decision to interview women homicide offenders} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 87 homicide cases, there were 28 in which a woman killed a man intimate 
partner. For these cases, the Advisory Board decided to expand the study to include 
inter\-views of the women. We did this for two reasons. We were having a great deal of 
trouble finding and interviewing knowledgeable proxy respondents, and we reasoned 
that, if the surviving women offenders were willing to talk to us, they were certainly 
knowledgeable respondents. In addition, since we had already developed and 
thoroughly tested the detailed clinic/hospital questionnaires, we could make the 
question\-naires for the women offenders directly comparable to the questionnaires for 
the clinic/hospital women. Thus, information from the woman offenders would be easy 
to compare to information from the abused women, which was one of the goals of the 
CWHRS.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, we decided not to try to interview men offenders. First, we did not have 
the resources, because there were 57 men offenders compared to only 28 women 
offenders. Second, seeking permission from the Department of Corrections to interview 
the women in prison was difficult and time consuming by itself, and we did not have the 
time to seek permission for all of the incarcerated men. Third, there was no appropriate 
questionnaire that we could easily adapt for the men, as we had for the women. Fourth, 
we were concerned about the safety of our interviewers, particularly if they attempted to 
interview men offenders who were not in prison.\par
}{\plain \f1 7. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Additional consultants and staff} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because of the key importance of interviewer training, we found it necessary to 
hire a professional trainer to help us organize and lead the initial sessions. The staff 
and collaborators learned from this, and we were able to conduct the follow-up training 
and proxy interviewer training without hiring a trainer. This turned out to be an 
advantage. Because there was no intermediator in the follow-up and proxy interviewer 
training sessions, the interviewers had a much greater opportunity to interact with the 
project staff and collaborators. This increased their identification with the project, their 
feeling of being collaborators in the project, their knowledge of the project goals and the 
reasons for the methodology they would be using, and their trust of project 
administrators.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We hired one of the interviewers to become a staff \'93Follow-up Coordinator.\'94 This 
was a key decision, largely because of the talents and expertise of Teresa Johnson, the 
Follow-up Coordinator.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because of the difficulty of the initial interviews and the length of time it took to 
do them, we lost some of our clinic/hospital interviewers. Others had to take additional 
jobs, which competed for their time. In response, we increased the per-interview 
payment to interviewers from $30 to $40. This payment did not include data entry, 
which the original proposal had specified. Instead, one of the interviewers, who was 
especially talented at database management, did almost all of the data entry. She was 
paid $10 per interview. At the point in the project where we had become inundated with 
data, we hired this person, Charmaine Hamer, to become the Data Coordinator. 
Working directly under the supervision of Christine Martin, she was responsible for 
cleaning the data and organizing the Microsoft ACCESS files to be downloaded into 
SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, we had not budgeted for translation. We had expected to be able to hire 
a project manager who knew Spanish. This was naive. We discovered that the task of 
translating is not a simple job. (See below for a detailed discussion.) Much of the 
translation was done by two of the collaborators, working closely with a focus group of 
neighborhood residents and staff from Erie Family Health Center. However, the produc\-
tion of the final Spanish versions of the six questionnaires and the consent forms 
required more. Two of the interviewers, Iliana Oliveros and Alicia Contreras did this 
work, charging very little. It was one of their many contributions to the CWHRS, and one 
of the many reasons why the interviewers in the CWHRS were truly collaborators.\par
}{\plain \f1 8. {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Re-conception of the proxy study methods} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab After we had tried for several months to identify potential proxy respondents and 
contact them for an interview, and had failed to get even one interview, we became 
rather discouraged. At that point, we talked at length with Judith McFarlane, who was 
conducting a similar \'93proxy study\'94 in Houston, as part of a ten-city project coordinated 
by Jacquelyn Campbell at Johns Hopkins. Judith had been able to contact and 
successfully interview proxy respondents in 100% of Houston cases. Therefore, we 
knew that these proxy interviews are possible to do. So that the Chicago project could 
be successful as well, we asked Judith to tell us her methods (see Appendix VI).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One major change strongly recommended by Judith was to have the same 
persons (the proxy interviewers) do both the field work and tracking to identify, as well 
as interview the appropriate proxy respondent(s). We also decided to greatly expand 
interviewer training and support for the proxy study. The proxy interviews proved to be 
so difficult and stressful that it was necessary for the psychological consultant to hold 
interviewer debriefing sessions (Appendix V) every week instead of every other week, 
and to continue the sessions after the interviews had been completed.\par
{\tc {}{\plain \b\f1 Assuring Subjects' Safety, Privacy and Confidentiality} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though issues of safety, privacy and confidentiality are basic to all research with 
human subjects (Sieber, 1992), they are especially important in a study of violence, 
because of the potential danger to the women who were interviewed, the research staff, 
and third parties (Gondolf, 1998; Monahan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993). The CWHRS was aware of 
and concerned about the potential for the project to elicit trauma and distress for both 
the women being interviewed and the interviewers, and about possibly jeopardizing the 
woman's safety should the abuser find out about her participation. We took this very 
seriously, and implemented extra\-or\-dinary mea\-sures to protect subjects.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of three sites (Cook County Hospital, 
Chicago Department of Health and Erie Fam\-ily Health Center) approved the project 
design and consent forms and monitored the project. After long deliberation, the 
collabor\-ators decided that the consent form would tell women that there would be one 
exception to confidentiality -- everything she might tell us would be kept confidential, 
except for imminent danger to themselves or others. Gondolf (1998) also found that this 
exception is necessary in research with a population of batterers and the women they 
are abusing.\par

}\pard \sl1 
{\plain \f1 \tab The organization plan of the study included a long set-up period (see Exhibit 3, 
above), during which the consultants and Advisory Board worked intensively to develop 
procedures to ensure respondent safety. Our guide to the best techniques for ensuring 
safety was the pioneering methodology of the }{\plain \i\f1 Violence Against Women}{\plain \f1  re\-search 
(Johnson, 1993). Holly Johnson, who was instru\-men\-tal in the develop\-ment of safety 
proce\-dures in that survey, contributed her advice to the develop\-ment of the CWHRS 
design, and served as a consultant to the study. Respondent safety was a particular 
concern of all the collaborators on the project, but especially Jacquelyn Campbell, 
Barbara Engel, Eva Hernandez, Leslie Landis, Kim Riordan, Wendy Taylor, Richard 
Tolman and Carole Warshaw.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the meetings and frequent mail and phone communica\-tions among the collab\-
ora\-tors, respondent safety was a primary concern. Local shelter workers and health 
workers joined the collaboration and the discussion. We also received feedback from 
the site Advisory Board of neighborhood residents. When new safety concerns arose 
during the course of the project, all the collaborators reached consensus on how to 
proceed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Like Watts, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , (1998) and Gondolf, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., (1998), we found that including 
experienced advocates in the CWHRS decision-making process helped to translate our 
safety and confidentiality standards into rigorous polices and proce\-dures. Advocates 
suggested, for example, that we change the study\'92s name, to avoid the possibility that 
someone at a site might inadvertently refer to an interviewer as the person working on 
the \'93abuse\'94 or \'93risk of death\'94 study within the hearing of a potential abuser. This could 
have jeopardized the safety of both the women being interviewed and the interviewers. 
Also, direct reference to violence could have scared off potential interviewees, 
particularly high-risk but under-served women.\par
\tab An overriding concern in the initial interviews was that the study would not 
jeopar\-dize provision of care to the abused women. The normal procedures of the 
hospital or health centers continued throughout the project, providing regular agency 
support, refer\-rals and emergency care. A CWHRS policy was that an initial interview 
was never conducted unless there was a support person or counselor available at the 
clinic or hospital in case of need.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The safety protocol in each site and department varied, but the following safe 
practice procedures were followed everywhere: women should not appear to be singled 
out for screening, the word \'93abuse\'94 would never be used in a public setting, and the 
transition from screener to interviewer would be accomplished discretely. To avoid any 
situation in which an abuser might discover that his or her intimate partner was being 
interviewed about the abuse, we trained everyone associated with the project to refer to 
it as the \'93Women\'92s Health Risk Project,\'94 and all project materials carried that title.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the key standards of the CWHRS specified that women would be inter\-
viewed in complete privacy in the initial interviews, including a room with a closed door. 
Meeting this standard proved to be a very difficult task in the large public inner-city 
hospital and public health clinics that we used as interview sites. It was accomplished 
only through repeated and lengthy meetings with site staff at each clinic. However, 
because every\-one involved agreed that this standard was inviolate, we found a way to 
meet it in every case.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each clinic developed a protocol for providing advice and support to the women. 
At every clinic, we offered respondents a \'93palm-card\'94 with domestic violence referral 
information listed among other social service numbers. Based on the experience of the 
Violence Against Women Survey and the advice of Holly Johnson, the CWHRS 
instituted a toll-free telephone number for women to use if they had questions or 
needed assis\-tance or referrals. Also, we developed a protocol for answering the 1-800 
number, to use in case of an abuser calling to get information about the project.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Interviewers and staff did not try to be counselors. However, in the initial inter\-
views, the follow-up interviews, the proxy respondent interviews, and in response to 
calls on the 800 number, the CWHRS provided information about counseling and other 
available resources (see Appendix VII). We offered women a card with the numbers of 
helpful agencies, for her to take if it was safe to do so. Professionals among the 
CWHRS collaborators provided additional contacts and advice for proxy respondents 
and their families. In addition, collaborators developed a set of procedures that would 
be followed in a situation in which the woman or someone else was in danger (see 
Monahan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993: 393-394; Gondolf, 1998; Cowles, 1988:168). Fortunately, such 
an emergency situation never arose.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The interview itself seemed to be a positive experience for many of the women 
sampled in the clinic/hospital study, as well as the proxy respondents. For example, 
several women who were not being abused at follow-up told the inter\-viewer, when 
asked what had happened, that the initial interview had helped them to think through 
their situation and decide to change it. In the planning stages of the CWHRS, the 
collabora\-tors had anticipated that this kind of thing might happen. We knew that it might 
affect the quality of the research findings, but we felt strongly that the woman\'92s safety 
was more important. In the last analysis, we believe that the quality of the research was 
improved by our supportive methods, which led to the women\'92s high degree of trust and 
their willingness to share their experiences.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab CWHRS policy regarding child abuse and neglect issues was developed after 
long and difficult deliberation. If the questionnaires had included a direct question about 
child abuse, the informed consent would have to warn women who were about to be 
interviewed that the inter\-viewer would be obligated to report any disclosed child 
maltreatment to authorities. A pediatrician and domestic violence activists among the 
collaborators pointed out that it is possible that a child would be removed from a mother 
who is not abusive or neglect\-ful of her child if she discloses that she is living with an 
abusive partner. The possibility of catalyzing such a serious consequence propelled us 
to an uneasy consensus not to ask a direct question about child abuse. Instead, the 
question\-naire asked whether or not the partner \'93has been reported\'94 for child abuse. 
Mandated reporting rules would not apply in such a case, since it has already been 
reported.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the same time, however, we were concerned about the possible conflict 
between safety and confidentiality, not only for child abuse but also when the woman 
herself is in danger of immediate harm. Therefore, the consent form made two excep\-
tions to confidentiality: if a woman told us that a child was being abused even though 
the question was not asked, or if the woman, a child or someone else were in immed\-
iate danger of serious injury or death. A case like this never arose, but the protocol was 
to call the counselor while the woman was still in the interview room, and ask the 
counselor to work with the woman on the issues she had raised. These procedures 
were similar to those followed by Gondolf (1998).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Adequate attention to interviewer selection, training and monitoring was a key 
factor in both respondent and interviewer safety (see Monahan, et al., 1993: 394; 
Gondolf, 1998). Following the Canadian example and the advice of consultants and 
advisory board members, we carefully selected inter\-view\-ers on the basis of sen\-\-si\-tiv\-i\-ty 
to battering issues, communica\-tion skills and abil\-ity to handle personal stress (Norris & 
Hatcher, 1995), and provided extensive inter\-view\-er training and support, including the 
services of a psycho\-logist to counsel and advise the interviewers. Interviewers were 
trained to deal with emotional responses as they occurred, and to establish a sense of 
trust (Cowles, 1988).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, we found it vital to \'93take care of the collaborators,\'94 to address the 
personal repercussions of working on domestic violence. This was true for all of the 
collaborators, but especially true for those who interacted directly with the women. 
Listening to stories of violence can be disturbing and have negative consequences for 
mental health, attitudes toward abused women, quality of work, and longevity with the 
project. The CWHRS used many mechanisms to reduce these problems. The collabor\-
ators designed and implemented extensive and continuing trainings for interviewers, 
which resulted in a strengthened partnership, a tangible commitment to the study\'92s 
mission, group team building, and skills for safety and stress reduction. We also added 
a project counselor to the staff, a therapist with expertise in domestic violence and 
work-related stress. In regular group meetings and private sessions on request, she 
created a safe space for them to explore their reaction to hearing painful stories, taught 
relaxation and self-care techniques, and helped them to bond as a group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Follow-up Safety Issues} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . As Gondolf (1998) points out, the \'93aggressive tracking 
needed to obtain respectable response rates impinges on privacy and may be 
threatening to battered women.\'94 In the CWHRS follow-up interviews, one of the primary 
concerns with respondent safety was to give women as much control as possible over 
the time and location of the interview. The 800 number for subjects to con\-tact us with 
their questions and provide options for when and where they might partici\-pate became 
very important in the follow-up interviews. We could not use any information to search 
for a woman beyond the contact information she had given us in the initial interview, 
usually a safe number where she could be contacted and the name and contact 
information of at least one friend or relative who would know where she was. In general, 
women contacted us for their interview, either by paging the interviewer or calling our 
800 number, after receiving a letter sent to a safe address or seeing a sign at a clinic or 
shelter.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Our original goal was to conduct all of the follow-up interviews face-to-face.}{\plain \f1  We 
arranged for follow-up interviews to be conducted in a safe room at each of the original 
clinic or hospital sites, with the woman meeting the interviewer at the site. Since many 
women did not want or were not able to travel to the original site, we planned for the 
possibility that a follow-up interview might be conducted elsewhere, for example, at a 
local McDonald\'92s, a YWCA, or a church. However, we were concerned about the safety 
of the interviewer and the woman if we conducted interviews at the woman\'92s home. To 
this end, we developed a safety protocol for conditions under which an interviewer 
could safely conduct a follow-up interview.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the end, how\-ever, it often turned out to be impossible to conduct face-to-face 
follow-up interviews. Many women had moved, often out of state or even out of the 
country. For some of these women, this move had allowed them to escape from their 
abuser. It was a tribute to their confidence in their interviewer and their belief in the 
CWHRS goals that these women gave us their new address and phone number, which 
allowed the interviewers to conduct the interview over the phone. In addition, even if the 
study would pay for their carfare, many women had such compli\-cated lives that they 
would have been unable to travel to a face-to-face interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, many of the follow-up interviews were done over the phone. The 
protocol for safety in phone interviews was similar to that used by Gondolf (1998), and 
included asking if it was a safe time to speak, telling the woman what to do if they 
needed to hang up quickly (pretend that the phone call was a telephone solicitation and 
call back on the 800 number when it was safe). Like the Gondolf study, many women 
called us from or had us call them at a phone outside their home. In one case, however, 
this procedure did not work. In the middle of the interview, a woman mentioned that her 
intimate partner was present. She had been threatened only, the last threat had been at 
the beginning of the retrospective year, and she thought that it was a safe time and 
situation for her to speak on the phone with the interviewer. Thereafter, the interviewers 
were instructed to ask each women before the interview began whether or not she was 
alone, and if not, who was in the room.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Gondolf (1998) used a private locator to track some of the batterers and battered 
women in his sample. Although we used a locator to help us find potential proxy 
respondents, the collaborators decided that it would not be safe to ask the locator to 
help us find clinic/hospital women for a follow-up interview. In addition, we decided that 
using a locator would violate privacy, and go beyond the limited permission the woman 
had given us to find her. We did, however, ask the locator to find a contact person, in 
certain cases. At the initial interview, each woman was asked to give us contact 
information about one or more people who would know where she was. She signed a 
separate permission form for each individual. Interviewers would first call or write to the 
safe phone or safe address of the woman, but if she had no safe phone or address, or if 
she was no longer living at that address or the phone had been disconnected, the 
interviewer would call or write to her contact person. However, in some cases, we could 
not find the contact person. In these cases, we asked a locator to find a current address 
or phone for the contact person, and then the interviewer would make the contact, and 
ask the person to call us on the 800 number. This did lead to several follow-up 
interviews.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Closure} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Like any longitudinal study, the CWHRS had a tremendous 
responsibility to the clinic/hospital women, who had been working with us over a period 
of time. We established a policy to give them informa\-tion about the study, to offer them 
a palm card with resource contact numbers, to give them a copy of the study results if 
they wanted one, and tell them how they could get in touch with the study staff if 
needed, and to tell them how important their contribution was and to thank them 
sincerely.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We were especially concerned about closure with those clinic/hospital women 
who were still in an abusive relationship at the end of the study. Many of these women 
had worked with an interviewer for at least a year, who had been encouraging her to 
seek help, but had not been able to make that step. When the interviewer spoke to one 
of these women for the final time, she encouraged her to contact resources that the 
interviewer could particularly recommend. The interviewer also told her that she could 
call the principal investigator at the Authority if she needed another contact, or if she 
had anything she needed to talk about.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS developed the following procedure for distributing a summary of the 
results to a clinic/hospital woman when it might not be safe to mail it to her home:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- tell the woman, if she said that she wanted a copy of the study, that we could 
mail a flyer to her address or to another safe address, simply stating that the \'93Women\'92s 
Health Study\'94 report was ready and providing a number to call to receive or arrange to 
pick up a copy.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab --  put up signs on bulletin boards at each site, announcing that the report was 
available.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- have copies of the report available in waiting rooms at the sites.\par
\tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Proxy Study Safety Issues} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Safety issues in the proxy study focused primarily on 
the safety of the interviewers, who were to conduct fieldwork in some of Chicago\'92s high 
crime areas, in addition to conducting interviews about a very sensitive subject in proxy 
respondents\'92 homes. These safety considerations were taken seriously from the start of 
the project, beginning with the hiring and training of the interviewers. Candidates were 
carefully screened for their experience in working in the field and being comfortable with 
eliciting information from strangers to get leads for proxy contacts. Of the eight women 
who completed the hiring and training process, four actually stayed with the project for 
the entire seven month data collection phase, and became quite adept and comfortable 
in their dual roles of proxy locators and interviewers.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab During the 20-hour initial proxy interviewer training session, Rose Olivieri, a 
representative of the Chicago Police Department, gave an hour-long session on safety 
procedures in the field. As part of this training, the interviewers were given the names 
and phone numbers of all Chicago Police District Watch Commanders, and the inter\-
viewers were encouraged to contact the district before going in the field to announce 
their presence or to be warned about potentially dangerous situations.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Based on this training on common-sense safety rules and the safety plan 
developed by McFarlane and Wiist (1997) for outreach workers contacting pregnant 
abused women in the community, the interviewers developed safety procedures tailored 
for the CWHRS. They were encouraged to form partnerships to provide support for 
each other on field visits and in case development, and to conduct fieldwork during day 
time hours. Interviewers notified someone, either project staff, another interviewer, or a 
friend or family member, when they would be going into the field and when they came 
back. The principal investigator encouraged interviewers to call her at home at any time 
of the day if necessary.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The debriefing sessions held weekly with the interviewers became invaluable for 
airing their concerns and developing safety policies as new situations arose (see 
Appendix V). The interviewers found themselves in many unanticipated locations and 
situations when attempting to locate or interview proxy respondents. Some solutions 
that worked to overcome potential safety concerns were to conduct to proxy interviews 
over the phone or in neutral places such as the library or fast-food restaurants. In more 
than one case, it even became necessary for a team of interviewers to visit a bar during 
weekend nights to attempt to talk to the owner and any patrons who might remember 
the homicide. The rapport that developed among the interviewers, their conviction in the 
importance of the study and their safety training gave them the confidence to persevere 
in the face of a difficult assignment. Following the safety procedures instituted in the 
study, there were no threats or breaches of personal safety for any team member 
during the seven months of data collection.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The hiring of a private investigator to find proxy respondents followed 
considerable discussion among the collaborators. Instead of hiring interviewers who 
would only do the actual interview, the CWHRS proxy interviewers did both the locating 
and the inter\-viewing. However, at the very end of our data collection, there remained a 
considerable number of potential proxy respondents who could not be located. The 
collaborators had anticipated this, and in setting safety standards for the proxy study 
had decided that, if necessary, the study would employ a professional locator to find the 
location of potential proxy respondents, but not to actually contact them.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS placed strong constraints on the locator\'92s activity. The job descrip\-
tion stated, and the locator was repeatedly instructed, that the job was limited to finding 
a working phone number, current address, or other way to contact the person in 
question. The locator was not to try to introduce the study or otherwise speak to the 
person about the study. In addition, the locator was required to pass a background 
check and to sign the standard CWHRS privacy certification (see below) promising not 
to disclose any study information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the collaborators highly recommended a professional locator who had 
worked on several research studies, and who had a large network of information 
sources across the Chicago area. We paid this locator for each case in which the 
interviewer verified that the person located was indeed the person being sought, 
whether or not the interview actually took place. The locator was actually assigned at 
least twice as many cases as he ultimately got paid for, but succeeded in locating 18 
potential proxy respondents who would not have been located without him. More might 
have been located if there had been more time.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Procedures to Preserve Confidentiality} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS design assured both privacy of the women and confidentiality of the 
data. Privacy refers to the woman\'92s autonomy, the degree to which she can control the 
researcher\'92s access to herself (Sieber, 1992:44). Confidentiality, as laid out in the 
informed consent agreement, states \'93what may be done with the private information 
that the subject conveys to the researcher\'94 (Sieber, 1992:45).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Identifying information, whether in paper files or automated records, was stored 
separately from the data. Paper files were stored in a locked cabinet with control on 
access to the cabinet, and automated files were stored in a sub-directory to which only 
the Project Managers and Project Investigators had \'93read\'94 ac\-cess. In addition, the 
project did not collect any identifying information unless absolutely necessary. For 
example, the woman was not asked for the abuser\'92s name, or for the name of any other 
household member. However, it was important to be able to identify that person in the 
follow-up interviews. Therefore, the woman was asked to choose a made-up \'93Name\'94 
with which to refer to the abuser or to other people she may mention. At the follow-up, 
the interviewer asked the woman to provide follow-up information about Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This procedure proved to be a considerable problem in the follow-up interviews. 
Many of the women had more than one intimate partner, and often they had more than 
one abusing partner. As a result, we occasionally gathered follow-up information about 
the wrong person. When this was discovered, as the interview was being logged in and 
entered, we asked the interviewer to contact the woman to try to obtain information 
about the correct person. However, it was often very difficult to contact women who had 
no permanent address or contact information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To keep track of the interview before data entry, cases were assigned a prelimin\-
ary num\-ber, which was attached to the various parts of the interview (consent forms, 
screener, main questionnaire, calendar history, follow-up information form). This 
allowed the staff to mon\-itor the interview instruments, some of which contain individual 
identifiers, and to assure that all of these documents traveled securely from the 
interview site to the locked project files. Interviewers were trained to keep the 
completed forms secure and con\-fidential. The procedure was that the completed forms 
were never left in an \'93in box\'94 but must be handed directly to a Project Manager, who 
checked it for completeness and filed it in a secure file cabinet. At data entry, a 
permanent identification number was assigned to the case, and thereafter used in place 
of any names as an identifier in the automated dataset.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The project had an elaborate set of security procedures for especially sensitive 
information, which includes information that links the woman\'92s name and address to the 
iden\-tification number, and identifying information that must be collected in order to re-interview the 497 women in the clinic/hospital sample. Access to the sensitive data file 
was limited to the principal investigators, project manager and those inter\-viewers who 
need to know. An automated data file containing sensitive information was stored in a 
pro\-tected, private file, to which only the principal investigators and project managers 
had access. A backup copy of the sensitive data file, written to disc, was stored in a 
separate place in the locked file cabinet.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Collaboration Methodology} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The many agencies and individuals who collaborated to accomplish this complex 
project feel that the collaboration was successful because it evolved, developed a col\-
lab\-orative culture, had permeable role definitions, and agreed upon a few central 
research and practice standards (Block, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999a 1999b). For a list of the 
collaborating agencies and individuals in the CWHRS, see Appendix I.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In many collaborations (for example, Galinsky, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1993), researchers focus 
on scientific methods and practitioners focus on the project\'92s impact on clients and 
agency resources. In contrast, shared standards were a cornerstone of the CWHRS. 
Through long hours of intense deliberation, we developed a few inviolable principles for 
research and practice. Each collaboration member understood these standards, and 
carried them out in project decisions. Shared standards became the spine of the 
CWHRS and the foundation of the trust necessary to accomplish our tasks.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To develop shared fundamental standards, we found that several things are 
necessary. First, the standards must be clear and limited to a small number. Every 
collaborator must under\-stand, support, be able to explain to others, and put into 
practice each of the standards. This is impossible if the standards are numerous or 
vague. Second, the researchers must learn about practice issues and the practitioners 
must learn about research issues (Gondolf, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1998: 259; Kondrat & Juli\'e1, 1997). 
The CWHRS did this in many ways. We provided opportunities for group members to 
\'93tour\'94 the worlds of other group members, and shared copies of articles and 
publications relevant to the study with everyone involved in the project, and learned to 
respect differences in awareness, leadership, philosophical orientation and type of 
medicine practiced. Third, }{\plain \f1  it is vital }{\plain \f1 to allocate sufficient time to come to consensus 
about the standards. Though unanimity is not required for many project decisions, it is 
for these few principles.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although the CWHRS model would not suit everyone, we found multiple benefits 
from our collaborative culture. Everyone who participated in the project benefitted, 
because each collaborator learned, taught and stretched. We first recognized and 
appreciated each other\'92s strengths, and then over time we surprised ourselves by 
finding new talents and capabilities within ourselves.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The institutions that participated benefitted, because they increased their aware\-
ness of domestic violence in their setting, and understood their own response to 
identifying and assisting victims. Health clinic staff were trained in domestic violence 
issues and support. Most important, however, was that the project became a catalyst 
for institutional change in many of the participating agencies, bringing them closer to 
universal screening for domestic violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Respondents in the CWHRS benefitted, because they had the chance to talk 
about the violence in their lives with a respectful, non-judgmental listener and received 
a token but often helpful fee. For the abused women, the relationship with their inter\-
viewer lasted for a year or more, and many of them looked to her for information about 
commun\-ity domestic violence resources. Many of the proxy respondents also 
developed a close relationship with their interviewer, and, though they were often 
reluctant at first, found the interview itself to be a positive experience. Both clinic and 
proxy respondents knew that they had contributed to efforts to decrease violence 
against women. Campbell (1992) has noted that the completion of the Danger\- Assess\-
ment instru\-ment and history may increase safety by focusing women's attention on pat\-
terns of violence in the relation\-ship. Johnson (1992) cites similar benefits of the 
Canadian survey. (The CWHRS comparison group controls for this "instrumen\-ta\-tion 
effect".)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, the research benefitted; the high quality of the data was a direct result of 
our collaborative efforts. The extensive collaboration on survey instruments, based on 
shared research and practice standards, produced questions that were relevant to the 
realities and risks in the lives of abused women and were written in culturally compe\-tent 
and non-judgmental language. If we had not worked intensely with each health center 
to create a safe and respectful interview climate, a key goal of the project - to include 
high-risk but under served women in the sample \'96 would not have been met.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborative culture enabled us to work until we found ways to collect data 
safely and to retain women in the study over the twelve-month study period. Without the 
efforts of the whole team, we would not have found, hired, trained and supported the 
best possible interviewers. Data interpretation benefitted from the collaborators\'92 
experiences in understanding women\'92s responses to abuse, and their suggestions for 
data analysis led to new information of critical importance to practitioners. Finally, due 
to the diversity of our collaboration, we anticipate being able to widely disseminate our 
results and to influence policy more effectively.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborative culture in the CWHRS was slow to develop, led to long 
decision making processes and required compromise on all sides in order to reach 
consensus. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that our model of equal collaboration 
between \'93researchers\'94 and \'93activists\'94 is what produced reliable and valid information for 
service providers hoping to reduce the danger of death or life-threatening injury to 
women experiencing intimate violence. We would challenge others contem\-plating 
similar research to consider our less traditional model.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 CLINIC AND HOSPITAL STUDY METHODS}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The purpose of the CWHRS was }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  to provide population-based estimates of 
the prevalence of domestic violence in Chicago. Instead, we wanted to provide practical 
information to people working with women who are physically abused by an intimate 
partner. We wanted to be able to tell them what are the combinations of factors that 
might suggest that an abused woman is at high risk for serious injury or death.\par
}{\plain \f1  \tab The design for the clinic/hospital study involved detailed face-to-face inter\-views 
with women sampled at \'93point-of-service\'94 as they came into a hospital or clinic for any 
kind of treatment, and two follow-up interviews over a one-year period with sampled 
women who had been physically abused in the last year in the initial interview. The 
CWHRS conducted domestic violence screening and detailed face-to-face inter\-views 
with women as they came into a hospital or health care clinic for any kind of treatment. 
We screened over 2,600 women and completed 707 initial inter\-views, 497 who inter\-
viewed as AW, 208 as NAW, and two who became ineligible after the inter\-view.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To gather prospective data, women who reported being abused were re-inter\-
viewed twice during the twelve months after the initial interview. Interviews averaged 45 
minutes and included developing a retrospec\-tive calendar of abuse incidents 
(Campbell, 1993) as well as information on power, control, harassment and stalking in 
the relation\-ship; demo\-graphics; household compos\-ition; physical health; pregnancy; 
substance use; mental health (depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder); 
firearm availabil\-ity; social support network; interventions and help-seeking.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Clinic and Hospital Sample} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Our goal was not to obtain a representative sam\-ple of all women, but of abused 
women, some of whom may be at high risk of death. To provide the most useful 
informa\-tion to practitioners, we sampled at a point of agency contact. Other goals were 
to include \'93hidden\'94 women (women at high risk who are not known to be at risk by any 
helping agency); to include enough cases to conduct separate profiles of the three 
racial/ethnic groups (African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic and white or other); and 
to sample enough expectant mothers to be able to analyze risks inherent in that 
situation.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS sampling task targeted women currently being physically abused 
by an intimate partner, which is a \'93hidden population.\'94 A hidden population exists when 
\'93no sampling frame exists and public acknowledgment of membership in the population 
is potentially threatening\'94 (Heckathorn, 1997:174). Sample surveys are not efficient for 
hidden populations, since most are rare, and they do not produce reliable samples, 
since the social stigma (and, in the case of domestic violence, the potential of physical 
retribu\-tion) leads sampled individuals to refuse to participate or conceal information. 
Neither is a sampling strategy based on a some agency or institutional list (such as the 
clients of a shelter or other service) appropriate, since such samples could not be 
generalized to people who do not appear on any agency list (Watters & Biernacki, 
1989: 417).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Heckathorn (1997) reviews three methods of sampling hidden populations, 
snow\-ball sampling (Goodman, 1961), key informant sampling (Deaux & Callaghan, 
1985), and targeted sampling (Watters & Biernacki, 1989). Chain referral methods such 
as snowball sampling might have jeopardized women\'92s safety. The use of key infor\-
mants, such as counselors, would have raised confidentiality issues and would not 
have captured women who did not visit counselors. Instead, the CWHRS employed a 
set of strategies similar to targeted sampling, though they were developed 
independently. First, using maps of the city, we identified areas in which the rate of 
intimate partner homicide was high, and chose clinics and hospitals in those areas. 
Second, in each clinic or hospital, we sampled women from the general population. 
Third, we made a consider\-able effort to develop sampling procedures in each 
department of each site that would not exclude women from participating.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS sampling strategy targeted specific neighbor\-hoods of the city 
where the lethal inti\-mate vio\-lence rate was high. At health-care settings within these 
neigh\-bor\-hoods, we sampled women hospital trauma and walk-in clinic patients and 
clinic/health center patients who were aged 18 or older, as they came into the health 
care setting for service. The strategy called for screening all women, using a standard 
set of screening questions. Our target was to interview every woman who screened AW 
(physically abused by an intimate partner in the past year), and to interview two women 
screening NAW for each five women screening AW. }{\plain \f1 Regardless of screening status, 
women who inter\-viewed as AW became the abused sample, and women who inter\-
viewed as NAW became the comparison group. }{\plain \f1 The final sample (Exhibit 4) was 497 
women inter\-viewed as AW (282 at health centers and 215 at the hospital) and 208 
NAW compari\-son group women (108 clinic and 100 hospital).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Site Selection} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  There were four point-of-service sample sites, Chicago Women\'92s Health Center, 
Roseland Health Center, Erie Family Health Center, and Cook County Hospital, which 
were chosen because they were in neighbor\-hoods with a high risk for intimate partner 
homicide, relative to other Chicago neighborhoods, based on analysis of intimate 
partner homicide risk rates by neighborhood, using the Chicago Homicide Data\-set.\par

{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The target neighborhoods chosen for the CWHRS were initially the near and far 
West Side and the West Town and Humboldt Park areas of Chicago. On the West Side, 
residents of the Austin and North Lawndale areas were 73% and 96% African/American/Black, respec\-tive\-ly, in 1990, and 44% and 88% of households were below 
the 200% poverty level. West Town and Humboldt Park residents were 57% and 41% 
Latino/Hispanic, respective\-ly, with 68% and 55% of households below the 200% 
poverty level. Annual intimate homicide rates per 100,000 population in 1990-1992 
were 5.4 and 3.8 in North Lawndale and Austin, respectively,  4.1 in West Town and 1.0 
in Humboldt Park.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab After the study had begun, but before any interviewing had begun, we added a 
Chicago Department of Public Health clinic on Chicago\'92s far south side. This was done 
to include women from another Chicago area with high domestic violence homi\-cide 
rates. In addition, we added a downtown site, the Chicago Women\'92s Health Clinic, in 
order to capture more white women and women with same-sex relationships, and we 
also worked closely with a downtown hospital with a more diverse patient population, in 
order to include the hospital as one of the sampling sites.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Since Chicago is a city of neighborhoods with high levels of racial segregation 
(Massey & Denton, 1987), any sample drawn within neighborhoods will tend to be 
racially strati\-fied by neighborhoods. Therefore, the women sampled in each health care 
setting in the CWHRS tended to represent a particular racial/ethnic group. Knowing this, 
the collab\-orators made extensive efforts to include these two additional sites that would 
provide a more diverse sample. However, neither effort was successful. The Chicago 
Women\'92s Health Clinic, possibly because its director changed three times over the 
course of data collection, never became one of the key collaborating sites. Only 48 
cases were screened and eight women interviewed. The down\-town hospital also never 
became a participant in the study, although it had initially expressed a great deal of 
interest.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The staff of each of the other three study sites, and the separate clinics or prac\-
tices within each site, became key collaborators in the project. They worked hand-in-hand with the interviewers and project staff to ensure that the sampling goals are being 
met and that safety and privacy are priority considera\-tions. In all, site staff and project 
interviewers did screening interviews with over 2,600 women at point of service.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Screening Instrument} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The screeners used in the CWHRS (see Appendix III) were based on the 
Intimate Violence Screening Tool developed by the Chicago Depart\-ment of Health 
(Warshaw, 1992; Sheridan & Taylor, 1993; Moss & Taylor, 1991). The proposal for this 
project refers to this as the \'93standard Public Health Screener.\'94 However, this was naive. 
Even though the agencies and individuals who had developed this screener were 
members of the collaborative team that had planned and designed the study, when we 
actually began to work with the staff in the hospital and public health clinics we 
discovered that there was no \'93standard\'94 screener.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Further, the screener that had been developed at the hospital and that we had 
thought the hospital was using turned out not to be acceptable to hospital staff. There\-
fore, CWHRS staff and collaborators worked with staff at each department at each site 
to develop a screener that would be acceptable to the department, would not interfere 
with the women\'92s health care in any way, and meet CWHRS safety and research 
standards.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The format of the screener was slightly different at each site, but whatever the 
format, it included three questions: \'93Has your intimate partner ever hit, slapped, kicked 
or otherwise physically hurt or threatened you?\'94, \'93Has your intimate partner ever forced 
you to engage in sexual activities that made you uncomfortable?\'94, and \'93Are you afraid 
of your intimate partner?\'94 The first two questions have two follow-up questions: \'93How 
long ago did the most recent incident occur?\'94 and \'93The person who did this was your 
[list of relationships].\'94 The woman was also asked her age and whether she would like 
to be referred to a counselor. A positive answer to any of the first three questions 
constituted an \'93AW\'94 result on the screener, if the abuse was within the past year, the 
abuser was an intimate partner, and the woman was at least 18 years old.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Sample Screening Process} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The highest-priority research standards in the CWHRS pertained to sample 
selection: use the same questions to screen all women, and minimize selection bias. 
Research had shown that staff in medical settings may be reluctant or unable to deter\-
mine whether their patients are in an abusive relationship (Warshaw, 1989; Morrison, 
1988; Sheridan & Taylor, 1993), and that a screening protocol increased identification 
from 5.6% to 30%(McLeer & Anwar, 1989). Therefore, CWHRS design called for 
screening all present\-ing women patients (\'93universal screening\'94). The screener, which 
determined both if a woman had a history of physical abuse by an intimate partner in 
the past year and if she wanted to participate in the study, was instituted into the 
standard intake procedure for all women receiving care in each hospital, clinic or health 
center. By incorporating the screening as a normal step in the treatment process, the 
study assured that participants did not become a focus of attention for others receiving 
care in the hospital and clinic.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because the inclusion of high-risk but under-served women was a priority, we 
were especially careful not to create any proce\-dure that would exclude women from the 
sample. For example, when we realized that some women who interviewed as abused 
had been screened as non-abused, we doubled the compari\-son sample in order to 
include any of these women. We limited the length of the interview, for fear that any\-
thing over an hour would prevent some women from being interviewed. The actual 
initial interview lasted about 45 minutes. We also were concerned about the possibility 
of  excluding women who might have children with them, and organized a provision for 
children in each site.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To assure anonymity and increase safety and security during the sample selec\-
tion and interview process, we developed a set of procedures at each clinic and 
hospital site. All interviews were conducted in a private and secure room, behind closed 
doors. How\-ever, each sample site contained several different clinics or units (Exhibit 5), 
which required the development of different sample screening methods. For example, 
universal screening at Cook County Hospital\'92s walk-in Ambu\-latory Screening Clinic 
(ASC) was a very different process with very different problems compared to universal 
screening at the hospital\'92s Level I Trauma Unit. Even though collaboration team 
members representing each of the data-collection sites had worked for many months to 
plan the screening process (see Exhibit 3 above), we were dis\-mayed to find when we 
went into the field that one of the basic foundations of the research design could not be 
carried out as planned.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Universal screening (asking every woman coming for treatment three short 
questions about abuse) was the official policy of the Depart\-ment of Public Health, the 
hospital and the family health center, but had not been implemented in the specific 
clinics. Most were screening, but not at the level required to minimize selection bias, 
one of the research standards of the CWHRS. For example, a practitioner would screen 
only when he or she suspected abuse. Some clinics were not asking about abuse at all. 
As a result, in the first two months of field work we enrolled far fewer women than we 
had anticipated.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To address this problem, the collaborators worked intensively with clinical and 
admin\-istrative staff at each site to develop a protocol for enrolling women into the study 
that would be consistent with CWHRS standards: minimize selection bias and ask every 
woman the same screening questions. We knew that clinic staff would not begin to 
screen for abuse simply because a research study was being conducted, and we 
realized that they faced obstacles in assessing for abuse, such as lack of training, 
personal discomfort with the issue, and time and resource constraints (Warshaw, 1993). 
Since each clinical setting (even those within the same institution) represented a unique 
situation, we searched for a flexible way to main\-tain these standards. Simultan\-eously, 
collaborators who help positions at the site worked as liaisons to inform site staff of the 
importance of the CWHRS and educate staff on domestic violence and screening.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Most of the clinic sites were comfortable using the paper screener, but one was 
concerned that such a sheet might mis\-takenly end up in a patient's chart. After many 
meetings and protocol drafts, we finally developed a protocol in which medical residents 
carried a laminated card with the three questions and recorded the woman\'92s abuse 
status on the morning log sheet. The attending physicians routinely reinforced this 
protocol among residents and nursing staff, and one of the surgeons from this setting 
later joined the project's collaborating team. At another site where the official policy was 
to screen but evidence suggested that screening seldom occurred, we decided not to 
challenge the stated policy but to hire staff to screen. For the women\'92s safety, we 
worked with the site to integrate our staff into the standard intake procedure of the 
clinic.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab By working with the staff of each care setting to figure out how to implement the

}{\plain \f1 \tab Though results varied by site, at least one clinic is still screening all patients 
more than a year after CWHRS data collection ended. The process generated by the

key standards that made this possible. With these shared standards, we could com\-

Women screened AW by answering yes to at least one of the three screening questions 
(physical abuse, sexual abuse, and \'93are you afraid?\'94). All sites using a paper screener 
included a question about the woman\'92s age. After giving their consent to speak to an 
interviewer, women were given a pre-inter\-view screener, which asked their age and 
whether they had been in an intimate relation\-ship in the past year. (Because many of

}{\plain \f1 \tab  Of the 2,198 eligible women (including the 17 interviewed women with missing 
screener information), 707 were interviewed (32%). The sample design called for inter\-
viewing every woman who screened AW, but only about two/fifths (40%) of the women 
who screened NAW. The great majority (86%) of the 524 women who screened AW 
were actually interviewed, and 31% of the 375 women who screened NAW but who had 
been abused over a year ago, but only 9% of the 1,278 women who screened NAW.

were inter\-viewed, from 100% at several sites to 50% of the 14 women who screened 
AW at the Erie Welfare to Work program. Similarly, the sites differed in the percent of

}{\plain \f1 \tab The 1,159 women who screened NAW but were not inter\-viewed were scattered 
randomly across sites and months. Of the 1,159, 997 (86%) did not sign the consent 
form (many were not asked for consent), three signed but refused the pre-screener, 
four did not have time, two did not have a Spanish-speaking interviewer available, and 
153 (13%) agreed to an interview but it never took place for other reasons.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Was There an Interview Selection Bias by Age or Language?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Woman\'92s Age} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The ages of the women screened ranged from 15 to 82, but the 
oldest woman interviewed was 67 years old. Of course, none of the 19 women under 
age 18 were inter\-viewed, because they were not eligible. However, for eligible women, 
her age seems to have been related to whether or not she was interviewed. There were 
two ways in which a screened woman might not be interviewed. First, she could decline 
her consent to an interview.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 We cannot reliably differentiate between women who denied consent and women who were not 
asked for their consent, especially for women screened as NAW. For almost all cases where the 
woman screened as AW and did not sign the consent, the person administering the screener noted 
that the woman did not want to be interviewed, or in a few cases, that the woman was not asked 
to sign. For many cases where the woman screened as NAW, however, she was not asked to sign 
the consent form. We were not trying to interview 100% of women who screened as NAW. For 
these women, an unsigned consent form does not necessarily indicate that the woman would not 
have consented to an interview.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Second, even if she gave her consent, she still might not 
be inter\-viewed for many reasons -- there was no interviewer available, the interview 
could not be scheduled, she had to leave for another appointment, and so forth. Older 
women were more likely to drop out of the interview process at both of these stages.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For women who screened AW, only 68% of the 19 aged 51 to 60 and a third of 
the six aged 61 to 67 were inter\-viewed, compared to over 80% of those in each 
younger age group (Exhibit 8). The 44 women not interviewed tended to be older than 
the 451 inter\-viewed women. Their mean age was 35.4 and ranged to age 82, compared 
to 31.1 and age 64 for the interviewed women (t test = -2.305; p = .022), though age 31 
was the median for both groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the women who screened NAW, the 1,159 women who were not interviewed 
were older on average than the 119 women who were interviewed, with a mean age of 
36.5 (median 34) years, ranging to 82, for non-interviewed women, compared to 28.9 
(median 27), ranging to 55, for interviewed women (t test = -5.594; sign <.001). In 
general, the older the age group, the less likely that a woman screened NAW would be 
interviewed. None of the 73 women aged 61 or older signed the consent form, and 
fewer than 2% of the 110 women aged 51 to 60 were interviewed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, women in age group 21 to 25 also had relatively lower interview rates 
than women who were somewhat younger (ages 18 to 20) or older (ages 26 to 30). For 
example, only 82% of the 88 women aged 21 to 25 who screened AW were 
interviewed, compared to 92% of slightly younger women aged 18 to 20 and 90% of 
slightly older women aged 26 to 30. The reasons for this are not clear, but may be 
related to the presence of children.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of all the sample sites, more older women were sampled at Cook County 
Hospital (CCH), and especially the Ambulatory Screening Unit (ASC), with the result 
that the mean age of women screened was much older at CCH than the other sites 
(Exhibit 9). In addition, women who completed an interview at Cook County Hospital 
were, on average, much older than women interviewed at the other sites. Sixty-five 
percent of inter\-viewed Cook County Hospital women were older than 30, and 28% were 
older than 40, but at Roseland, 26% were over 30 and 6% over 40, and at Erie, 37.5% 
were over 30 and 7% over 40. The most frequent age group for interviewed women 
was 18 to 20 at Roseland (36%), compared to only 10% at Cook County and 12% at 
Erie.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At Roseland Clinic, the mean age of women who were interviewed was }{\plain \i\f1 older}{\plain \f1 , not 
younger, than women who were not (25.2 versus 23.5 years). At Erie, the mean age of 
interviewed women was only slightly younger than that of non-interviewed women 
(28.95 versus 31.5). At CCH, however, the difference was greater (34.2 for interviewed 
woman versus 39.2 for non-interviewed women), and significant (t test = -2.598; p = 
.010).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Those women who completed an interview were categorized into AW and NAW, 
depending on the interview responses. Women who responded \'93yes\'94 to any of the 
physical violence questions in Section J of the questionnaire (see Appendix II), even if 
their only \'93yes\'94 was to the first question in that section, which is about a threat of 
physical harm, were categorized AW. Conversely, to be considered NAW a woman 
must have answered \'93no\'94 to every item in Section J. Thus, women could screen AW 
and interview either AW or NAW; they could screen NAW and interview either AW or 
NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  Also, if the interview revealed that the woman was not eligible for the study (she 
had not had an intimate partner in the past year), she was dropped from the sample. 
Two of the 707 women who were interviewed were dropped from the study, one 
because she later told us that she had falsified the initial interview, the other because 
she told us in the initial interview that she had had no intimate partner in the past year 
(her partner had died over a year previously). Thus, the final sample included 705 
women, 497 who inter\-viewed as AW and 208 who interviewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 453 women who screened AW and were interviewed, 405 (89%) inter\-
viewed AW, but 39 (9%) interviewed NAW and nine women (2%) interviewed NAW but 
said that they had been abused a year or more previously (Exhibit 10). Of the 119 
women who screened NAW and were inter\-viewed, 79% interviewed NAW, but 21% 
interviewed AW. This differed by site. At Roseland, only 6% of the 99 women who 
screened AW interviewed NAW. Similarly, at Cook County Hospital (CCH), 6% of the 
258 women who screened AW interviewed NAW. However, at Erie 18% of the 91 
women who screened AW interviewed as NAW. On the other hand, 24% of the 37 
women at Roseland who screened NAW and were interviewed, interviewed as AW, and 
21% of the 47 women at CCH, but only 16% of the 32 women at Erie. Thus, at Erie 
Family Health Center, more screened women changed from AW to NAW, and fewer 
screened women changed from NAW to AW.\par

}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, after a 45-minute interview with one of the project\'92s sensitive interviewers, 
39 of the women who had screened as AW interviewed as NAW. (In addition, one 
woman who screened \'93AW but date of abuse missing\'94 said in the interview that the 
abuse, by her current partner, had occurred many years ago.) What were the reasons 
for the difference between the screener and the interview for these 39 women? Two 
gave no further informa\-tion. Two had not been abused by an intimate partner, but by 
some\-one else (e.g.: a father, brother or stranger). Four women said in the screener that 
they had experienced \'93uncomfortable sex,\'94 but denied in the interview that the sex was 
forced (\'93forced you into any sexual activity you did not want to do, by threatening you, 
holding you down, or hurting you in some way\'94), and did not mention any other physical 
attack. One woman had been abused \'93many years ago\'94 by her current husband.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the great majority of the women (30 women, 77%) had screened as 
AW because they responded \'93yes\'94 to the \'93afraid\'94 question, and then the interview 
revealed that there had been no physical abuse in the past year. One woman\'92s 
boyfriend was very abusive, but he had been incarcerated for the previous year. Many 
women told the inter\-viewer they had been abused a number of years ago and were still 
feeling threatened by and were afraid of their partner or ex-partner. One woman had 
had no contact with the father of her children for a year, but knew that he was trying to 
take away the children. Other women said that their partner did not actually threaten to 
harm her, but she was afraid of him because of his look or attitude.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In these cases, the partner may have created an \'93atmosphere of coercion\'94 by 
previous violence, so that violence was no longer necessary to control the woman (Ellis 
& DeKeseredy, 1989: 75). Advocates often report such cases (Dobash & Dobash, 
1979), and they seem similar to the cases described by Paige Smith and her 
colleagues, in which abused women say, \'93He has a look that goes right through me and 
terrifies me\'94 (Smith, Earp & DeVellis, 1995a; Smith, Tessaro & Earp, 1995b; Smith, 
Smith & Earp, 1999). In retro\-spect, it would have been a good idea to have followed up 
on these women. Our criterion of \'93physically abused or threatened with violence in the 
past year\'94 may have been too stringent in these cases. Perhaps we should have 
expanded our criteria to include women who either were being currently abused by an 
intimate partner, or who were afraid of a current intimate partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 119 women who screened NAW and were interviewed, 25 (21%) revealed 
recent physical abuse to their interviewer. The physical abuse that these 25 women told 
us about in the interview but not in the screener was not necessarily trivial. Three of 
them had exper\-i\-enced at least one incident as severe as being beaten up, and six of 
them had exper\-ienced more than two incidents in the past year. Interviewer notes about 
some of these women mention that they did not think of themselves as being abused. 
One woman said that her partner was \'93very serious\'94 and \'93pushed her\'94 but never hit her. 
( Note that the CWHRS screener and ques\-tionnaires never use the word \'93abuse\'94 but 
instead ask ques\-tions about behavior.) Thus, in going through the questions one by one 
with a sensitive interviewer, these women were able to talk about the violence. Many 
practi\-tioners, including Jackie Campbell and Judith McFarlane, stress that it may be 
necessary to ask a woman repeatedly, over a long time period, if she is experiencing 
abuse, before she comes to feel that willing to tell you. These and other factors, in 
combination, produced the sampling patterns within the sites and departments shown in 
Exhibit 11. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Over all of the sites, the CWHRS sample contained 497 women interviewed as 
AW and 208 women interviewed as NAW (70.5% AW and 29.5% NAW), very close to 
our goal of 500 AW and 200 NAW. It is important to realize that these proportions are 
not indicative of the proportion of abused women overall or at a particular site, but 
reflect, rather, the sampling design of the CWHRS, and the degree to which screening 
staff members referred women screening NAW to the study. For example, the Hospital 
Care Interven\-tion Project (HCIP) at Cook County Hospital counsels abused women 
when referred by other hospital depart\-ments, such as the Trauma Unit or the 
Ambulatory Screening Clinic (ASC). The only women from HCIP who interviewed as 
NAW were women in which the abuse occurred over a year ago.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Did the CWHRS Meet its Sample Goals?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Some of the differences in the women sampled at different sites were part of the 
sample design. The CWHRS reached its sampling goals of including high-risk but under 
served women, including pregnant women, and so on, but these goals were reached 
across the entire sample. The sites and individual departments within sites differ in their 
characteristics (Exhibit 12 and 13). Therefore, direct comparisons across sites are not 
appro\-priate, because there is a different mix of women within each particular site.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For example, to reach the sample goal of including pregnant women, we made a 
special effort to sample women in Erie depart\-ments serving pregnant women. As a 
result, over a quarter (27%) of the interviewed women at Erie were pregnant at the 
inter\-view (Exhibit 12). In addition, of the 29 Erie women who had been pregnant in the 
past year, 82% had had a live birth, compared to 77% of the 44 women at Roseland 
and 62% of the 53 women at CCH.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Of course, by definition, it is difficult to know whether or not we have included in 
the sample women who are high risk, but who are not known to helping agencies. One 
indicator, for the 497 women who interviewed as AW, is whether or not the woman 
responded \'93yes\'94 to any of four help-seeking questions: talking to someone, seeing an 
agency or counselor, getting medical help, or contacting the police. Overall, 89 of the 
492 women who responded said that they had not sought any kind of help in the past 
year, and 26 of these women (3.5%) had experienced at least one severe incident 
(being beaten up, choked, permanently injured, or attacked or threatened with a 
weapon). In addition, of the 73 women who had experienced one or more severe 
incident and had tried only one type of help seeking, 49 had talked to someone but had 
not contacted an agency or counselor, sought medical help, or called the police in the 
past year. In total, then, at least 75 women (26 plus 49) in the CWHRS clinic/hospital 
sample, representing 15% of all 497 women, appear to have been \'93hidden women\'94 who 
were high-risk but were not known to be at risk by any helping agency.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The kinds of help sought by the 497 women interviewed as AW varied by the 
sample site (Exhibit 13), with 24% of the women at Erie saying that they had not sought 
any help, compared to 18% at CCH and only 13% at Roseland. Among those women 
who had experienced at least one very severe incident, however, there was also a 
difference across sites. At Erie, six of the 34 women (18%) who had experienced at 
least one severe incident said that they had not sought any kind of help, compared to 
12% of the 158 at CCH (10% of the 157) and only 9% of the 43 at Roseland.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another sample goal of the CWHRS was to include enough women of color in 
the sample, so that it would be possible to build individual high-risk profiles for African/American/Black women and for Latina/Hispanic women. This appears to have been 
accomplished for the sample as a whole, although not for the women sampled from 
each site (Exhibit 14). Of the 159 women who told us that their racial/ethnic group was 
Latina or Hispanic, 105 were interviewed in Spanish.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Almost half (47.9%) of the 701 women responding were unemployed. At Erie, 
36% of the women said that they had no personal income that they controlled, 
compared to 18% at Roseland and 13% at Cook County. Erie women were much less 
likely to have at least a high school education. Sixty-five percent of the women 
interviewed at Erie had less than a high school degree, compared to 33% at Roseland 
and 43% at Cook County. The only women in the sample with no schooling were four 
women at Erie.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the race/ethnicity question, we asked the woman to tell us, \'93Where 
were you born?\'94 Following feedback and advice from the Erie Advisory Group, we did 
not specifically ask women whether they were United States citizens, or if they were 
born outside of the United States. However, almost all of the women responded with a 
specific birthplace. Only about two-thirds (64%) were born in Illinois. Fully 13.5% were 
born in Central America, eight women (1.1%) in South America, and 10 women in 
Europe, Africa, Asia or the Middle East. Women interviewed at Erie were more likely to 
have moved to Chicago in the past year (4.6%) or to have lived here only one or two 
years (11.2%), compared to Roseland (1.2% and zero) or CCH (2.4% and 1.0%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Other differences across sites reflect the demographics of the population of 
patients at the site. For example, 79% of the interviewed women at Roseland said they 
were single, compared to 55% at Cook County and only 30% at Erie. At Erie, 43% said 
they were married, compared to 7% at Roseland and 18% at Cook County. Fully 42%

Roseland and 1% at Cook County.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Questionnaire Design} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The survey instruments, which included a screener and consent form for each 
site, the initial questionnaire for abused and comparison women, first and second 
follow-up questionnaires, screening questionnaires for potential proxy respon\-dents, 
proxy questionnaires for people who knew a woman or man victim, question\-naires for 
women who had killed their partner, and Spanish versions of all of these, were 
developed over many months of intense work by members of the collabor\-ating team. 
Advocates, activists, community members, academics and researchers all took an 
active role in finding, evaluating and devising scales for the various dimensions we 
hoped to capture, such as post traumatic stress disorder, physical and mental health, 
and social support.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because we could not find an instrument that met our criteria for a brief measure 
capturing the degree of concrete and emotional assistance available to the woman from 
her social support network, a task force of collaborators including domestic violence 
advocates, public health professionals and academics, worked together to construct a 
new scale. Perhaps it was easier to think outside the lines since some of our group 
were not trained as researchers. When none of the existing instru\-ments focused on 
what we believed the salient questions to be, we created our own tool. This kind of 
innovation is one of the exciting outcomes of collaboration. For those who were not 
researchers by training, it was empowering to demystify the process of research and to 
be part of creating a research tool.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Collaborators with backgrounds as support or health workers or as domestic 
violence activists wrote introductory scripts and constructed items and multiple 
response choices that reflected women's real experiences. Their expertise was vital to 
develop wording that would be universally understood and would build rapport with the 
women being interviewed. A particular concern was to eliminate any hint of judgmental 
language from the instru\-ments. These efforts seem to have been successful. 
Interviewers told us that the survey questions reflected the women's concerns and life 
situations. They elicited a high degree of coopera\-tion and quality data from a culturally 
diverse group of women. The project has begun to receive requests from agencies and 
researchers for these questionnaires, and we think that they may become a valuable 
resource.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Interviews averaged 45 minutes, and included a calendar assessment of abuse 
incidents; details of each incident; power, control, harassment and stalking; social sup\-
port net\-work; interven\-tions and help-seeking; demograph\-ics; house\-hold com\-position; 
mental and physical health; pregnancy; and firearm availability. To test and verify the 
questionnaire and scales, and to further develop subject safety standards, the pro\-ject 
began with a pilot study.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Some of the issues covered by the CWHRS related to highly sensitive topics, 
and women from different cultural backgrounds might have different perceptions of 
these sensitive issues. Therefore, the collaborators worked very hard to word ques\-tions 
and provide a context for those questions in a way that would encourage women to dis\-
close personal and sensitive experiences (Johnson, 1996:41-44; Smith, 1987). In 
addition, following the advice of Cowles (1988), we tried to keep the questionnaire short 
enough so that the woman would not be fatigued, and built in flexibility in the timing so 
as to \'93permit a natural flow of talk.\'94\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Spanish Translation} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Spanish translation of the instruments was done by members of the Erie 
Site Advisory Board and two members of the collaborative team. Though the process 
was time-consuming, it produced translations that were correct and culturally sensitive 
to Latina/Hispanic women from different countries of origin. Because we held the 
Spanish focus groups at a point where the English questionnaires were still in a flexible 
draft form, we could change the English version where necessary. This improved not 
only the Spanish but also the English instruments.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Calendar History of Incidents and Events} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For women who had answered \'93yes\'94 to at least one type of physical abuse in the 
past year (Section J), the interviewer and the woman, working together, filled out a 
calen\-dar with key events that had happened in her life in the past year, and each 
violent incident that had happened. The instru\-ment was a set of blank calendars 
(Appendix II), printed with one or two months per 8\'bd by 11-inch page, that the inter\-
viewer laid out on the table in front of the woman. They first placed holidays and 
important life events, some of which the women had already told the interviewer about, 
such as having a baby, changing jobs or moving. Then, for each violent incident, she 
and the interviewer placed it on a calendar date, using a series of codes developed by 
Campbell and expanded for this study.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Going into the first interviews, we were not sure that this process would succeed, 
but discovered that it worked very well. Women usually remembered these incidents 
clearly and were able to place them on the calendar. When a woman could not place an 
incident on the exact date, we asked her to choose a date in the correct sequence with 
other important things happening in her life; for example, just after her son\'92s birthday, 
on Mother\'92s Day, or on payday. Some women described a series of violent incidents 
that had taken place over a period of time. For example, one woman was beaten up 
every day for a week. Others said that, over a six-week period, they were punched and 
kicked twice every weekend by a partner who came home drunk. In every case, 
however, the woman was able to specify a specific window of time when these \'93series\'94 
incidents happened.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In coding and cleaning the data from the twelve-month retrospective calendars 
and the two calendars in the follow-up period, we noticed that women tended to tell us 
about more incidents that had occurred in the more recent months and days before the 
interview than had occurred ten or eleven months ago. There was a small (-.044) but 
significant (Pearson r <.01) correlation between the number of days before the initial 
interview when an incident had occurred, and the seriousness of that incident. For 
example, the 58 incidents involving weapon use or wounds from a weapon occurred 
134 days before the initial interview, on average, compared to 158 days for the 116 
incidents involving a weapon threat or very severe injury and 167 days for the 370 
incidents involving beating up, choking, or serious injury. Thus, we suspect that women 
did forget to tell us about some incidents that had occurred many months prev\-iously, 
especially less serious incidents. However, this procedure still elicited numerous 
descriptions of incidents, many of them on the less serious end of the scale, that had 
happened months earlier.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women indicated all violent incidents, regardless of who was the abuser. If more 
than one intimate partner was responsible for different incidents, the interviewer 
indicated this in the margins of the calendar. If someone who was not an intimate 
partner}{\plain \f1  was responsible}{\plain \f1  for an incident, that was also indicated (these violent incidents 
were coded as part of the \'93event calendar\'94 information, not the \'93incident calendar\'94 
information).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, for each violent incident, the woman and interviewer added codes on the 
appropriate calendar date describing a few key factors, including the presence or use of 
a firearm or handgun, whether or not anyone else was present (children, a friend of the 
woman, a friend of the partner, someone else), whether or not anyone else was injured, 
and any substance use of the woman and partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The proxy respondent questionnaire did not include the same type of calendar 
history as the clinic sample, since we doubted that proxy respondents would know 
about the woman\'92s life to that level of detail. Instead, we asked for details about three 
incidents, in addition to the details of the final incident that resulted in death. At the end 
of Section J, after a series of questions about any violent incident of the man against 
the woman and again after a second series of questions about any violent incident of 
the woman against the man, we asked the following question:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 Now thinking overall about physical violence of (V) against (P) in the year 
before [his/her] death, were there any particular incidents you were aware 
of that stand out in your mind, because they were severe or happened 
frequently or for any other reasons? If so, could you briefly tell me what 
happened and when?\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 \tab To provide a measure of the severity of violence in the past year for the lethal 
sample that would be comparable to the information provided by the women sampled in 
a clinic or hospital, we used all the available information for each homicide case to 
create a variable with three categories: no violence in the past year, less severe 
violence, and very severe, possibly life-threatening violence. To do this, we used all the 
information available in the case, including formal questions about physical violence 
(Section J, Questions J7\_J11), responses to open-ended questions, any narrative 
provided by any of the people interviewed in the case, and any information in official 
records. For example, in one case where the proxy respondent did not know of any 
violent incident in the past year, the court file mentioned that the offender had admitted 
to his friend that he had held a knife to his wife's throat as she slept, because he was 
sure she was having an affair.}{\plain \f1  Therefore, this case was coded \'93very severe violence\'94 in 
the past year.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Measures and Scales Built into the Questionnaire} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A goal of the CWHRS was to measure a tremendous variety of variables, 
covering conditions, circumstances and interventions changing over time in the past 
year that research has suggested may be related to high-risk intimate partner abuse 
situations. Another goal was to keep the interview short and as simple as possible, in 
order not to exclude any women from the sample. These goals were in conflict. The 
collaborators agonized over the questionnaire. Some \'93gold standard\'94 instruments, for 
example those measuring mental health conditions or social support, were much too 
long for our pur\-poses. We could not simultaneously include everything and also include 
the greatest possible detail about each variable. We had to choose. We chose to 
include as many variables as possible, but to limit some of them to short forms. In some 
cases, we developed new scales or new versions of old scales. In addition, the CWHRS 
expanded some instruments, such as the calendar history instru\-ment developed by 
Jacqueline Campbell, which had never before been used to cover a twelve-month retro\-
spec\-tive year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Violent Incident Severity} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Before deciding to use a modified version of the 
Campbell Severity Scale, the collaborators did a lengthy investigation of a number of 
options. In the original proposal, we planned to code the degree of injury in each 
incident, using a standard injury severity code, such as the Abbreviated Injury Scale 
(AMA Com\-mit\-tee on Medical Aspects of Automotive Safety, 1971; Association for the 
Advance\-ment of Automotive Medicine, 1990; Maull, 1987; Greenspan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 .,1985; 
Dove, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1980). However, in order to maintain confidentiality, we decided not to 
share information with the clinic and hospital sites, and therefore not to seek access to 
the medical records that would have pro\-vided the information necessary to use the 
Abbreviated Injury Scale in each incident. We considered using two shorter scales, the 
Berk scale (Berk, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1983: 199; Campbell, 1986) or the Injury Assessment Index 
(IAI) (Dobash & Dobash, 1995), but rejected the Berk scale as lacking detail and the IAI 
as too loosely organized.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborators then developed a draft injury assessment, which included a 
body map and a table scoring each of ten types of injury across over ten parts of the 
body. After many revisions and trials, this was eventually rejected for three reasons. 
First, we thought it was important to include certain types of injury that would not fit 
easily in any one category on the chart, such as having a miscarriage, being \'93beaten on 
all day,\'94 or being choked to unconscious\-ness. Second, the chart did not necessarily 
capture the degree of life-threatening injury in the incident, which was our main goal. 
Third, because the chart was extremely cumber\-some and time-consuming, it would not 
have been possible to complete it for each of the incidents that might occur over a 
year\'92s time.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We considered the possibility of collecting detailed information about only a small 
number of incidents (the most recent, the most serious, and the one that \'93sticks in the 
mind or bothered you the most\'94). After spending considerable time constructing such a 
questionnaire, we realized that it would not tell us about the changing events and 
circumstances in a woman\'92s life over the entire year, which was one of the goals of the 
CWHRS. We decided that it was more important to collect limited injury information 
about every incident, than to collect detailed information about selected incidents. 
There\-fore, we developed the system that was finally used in the study, based on the 
Campbell scale, but modified and expanded.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS questionnaire contained two measures of incident severity, the first 
an overall measure of violence in the previous year, and the second an incident-level 
measure of the severity of each violent event. We used a modified version of the CTS 
constructed for the Violence Against Women Survey by Statistics Canada (Section J) to 
categorize women into AW versus NAW groups. In these questions, the woman is 
asked whether \'93each thing has happened to you in an INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP . . . 
in the past year.\'94 Women who answered \'93no\'94 to every question in Section J were 
categorized as NAW. In the calendar history, which only women categorized as AW 
completed, the CWHRS used a modified version of the Campbell Incident Severity 
Scale to code the severity of each individual incident that had occurred in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Campbell seriousness codes became our index of incident severity. When 
the woman told her interviewer about a particular incident, it was recorded on the 
calendar date by a code designating the most serious thing that happened to the 
woman in that incident. The interviewer used the following scale, initially developed by 
Jacquelyn Campbell, to code the severity of each incident:\par
}\pard \fi-1440\li1440\tx1440

}{\plain \f1 \tab }{\plain \f1 Some examples of  incidents reported by women in the CWHRS, for each of the 
Campbell codes are shown in Exhibit 15.}{\plain \f1  There were two coding rules for the Incident 
Severity Scale. First, the highest applicable number applied. Second, a given severity 
level was coded if any of the things listed in the category had happened.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To be sure that the interviewers understood how to administer the calendar 
history and code the incidents, Jacquelyn Campbell was one of the teachers in the two-week interviewer training. The collaborators added to or modified some of the types of 
behavior or injury in these items, building on their experience with women in high-risk 
abuse situations. Within the necessary constraints on the length of the inter\-view, we 
tried to include injury and behavior that they had found to be especially indica\-tive of the 
descriptions of abuse by women who were in life-threatening situations, and also to 
include types of injury that could have resulted in death.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The general category, \'93beaten up,\'94 was included, because the counselors and 
advocates among the collaborators told us that many women would not want to provide 
a lengthy list of each specific injury she had sustained in an incident, but would just say 
that she had been beaten up, beaten all over, or beaten all day.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Similarly, many collaborators had found choking (code 3) and loss of conscious\-
ness (code 4) to indicate a particularly dangerous kind of violence. We included being 
\'93grabbed around the neck\'94 as being choked. If the woman was choked to the point of 
losing consciousness, the incident was coded 4. In the development of the Spanish 
ques\-tionnaire, we found that the literal translation of \'93choked\'94 implies actual death 
(ahorcar, literally \'93hanging\'94). We therefore changed the Spanish to \'93ha tratado de 
ahorcarla\'94, and the corresponding English to \'93tried to choke you.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We defined weapon \'93use\'94 to include any use of a weapon whether or not anyone 
was injured, for example, a gun was fired but missed or a knife was held to her neck. 
We defined \'93weapon\'94 as any tool capable of committing physical harm. Arson was 
counted as a weapon (in one case, an abuser tried to murder a woman by burning her 
house down). A car was counted as a weapon, when Name deliberately tried to run 
over her. A gun used as a blunt object also constituted weapon use, as did any blunt 
instrument (for example, a telephone, a heavy ashtray, a grill, or a rock). Similarly, any 
sharp object, not just a knife, constituted a weapon (for example, a screwdriver or 
broken glass). Tools used to beat or strangle the woman, such as a belt or pantyhose, 
were weapons. We counted incidents in which Name deliberately tried to infect the 
woman with HIV as weapon use. Throwing scalding water or acid constituted weapon 
use, as did an attempt to drown the woman in the bathtub.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To count as a weapon threat (code 4), the women had to believe that the 
weapon would be used against her. She did not have to see the weapon. For example, 
we counted threats of weapon use over the phone as a \'93weapon threat\'94 when the 
woman had reason to believe that the threat would be carried out.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although the Campbell scale questions are similar to the modified CTS ques\-tions 
in Section J, they differ in one important way. The CTS items ask only about behavior, 
while each Campbell scale question combines behavior with injury. For example, if a 
woman was slapped or pushed but suffered a head injury (i.e.: she was pushed down\-
stairs), the incident would be coded \'934,\'94 not \'931.\'94 Conversely, if the woman was not 
injured seriously but a weapon was used, the incident would be coded \'935". This 
produced some anomalies, with some incidents coded \'934" involving much more injury 
that some incidents coded \'935" (see examples in Exhibit 15, above).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There is a rough correspondence between the items in the Campbell scale and 
items in Section J, the Statistics Canada modification of the CTS (see Appendix II). 
How\-ever, there are several differences. The \'930" category, \'93threat to hit with a fist or 
anything else that can hurt you,\'94 was not in the original Campbell Incident Severity 
Scale, but was added to the scale in the CWHRS, because our definition of physical 
violence in the past year included this threat category (see Item J1, initial 
questionnaire). The \'931" category of the Campbell scale corresponds to questions J3 
and J4 of the modified CTS, and the \'932" category corresponds to J5. The \'933" category 
corresponds to J7 and J8, except when the choked woman loses consciousness.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There is no single Campbell code that directly corresponds to item J2 of the 
modified CTS (. . . thrown anything at you that could hurt you). If Name used a tool that 
could hurt her, we counted such incidents as \'93weapon use.\'94 For example, Name might 
have thrown acid, or scalding water, or a rock. In a few cases where it was unclear 
whether or not the object thrown could have hurt her (for example, \'93threw a bottle at 
her\'94), we coded the incident \'931" (slapping, pushing, throwing something that can hurt 
you). However, when it was not clear whether the object thrown was actually thrown at 
her, or when it probably could not have hurt her, we coded the incident \'930" (threat to hit 
with a fist or anything else that can hurt you). For example, Name might have thrown a 
plate of food, or threatened to throw an ashtray.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The \'934" and \'935" cate\-gories correspond to J6, J9 and J10, except that the 
modified CTS ques\-tions differen\-tiated between knives and guns, while the Campbell 
scale ques\-tions differen\-tiated between weapon threat and weapon use. (A follow-up 
question in the calendar history specified whether the weapon in the incident was a 
gun, what type it was, and if it was fired.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the Campbell Incident Severity Scale, we asked women to tell us 
about some other aspects of each incident. A \'93TD\'94 was placed on the calendar date on 
each incident where she said \'93yes\'94 when asked did Name \'93tie you up, handcuff you or 
restrain you?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Forced sex, defined as \'93forced you into any sexual activity you did not want to 
do, by threatening you, holding you down, or hurting you in some way,\'94 was coded by 
placing an \'93S\'94 on the calendar date when it had occurred (see Section J, Q11). A 
miscar\-riage \'93as a result of the incident\'94 was coded by placing an \'93MC\'94 on the calendar 
date of the incident. If the woman said that a weapon was used, we coded \'93HG\'94 for 
handgun or \'93LG\'94 for long gun on the calendar date, and circled that code if the gun had 
been fired. We asked who was present (children, bystanders, adult friend of R, or 
another adult) and if they had been injured. We also asked if R or Name had been 
drunk, high on marijuana, or using drugs during the incident. Thus, whether any of 
these things happened in an incident was recorded indepen\-dently from the seriousness 
scale.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Most women who told us about forced sex in an incident also told us about the 
specific violence or threat of violence that had accompanied the forced sex. However, 
sometimes women told us about forced sex that had not happened together with any 
other violence (Exhibit 16). For example, one women experienced forced sex in which 
the partner had threatened to take her children away.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though our definition of \'93forced sex\'94 includes violence or the threat of violence 
(see question J11), the interviewers sometimes would note \'93forced sex\'94 on the calendar 
without indicating the type of violence or violent threat. For a few women, one or more 
incident of forced sex, with no information about any violence or threat of violence, was 
the only incident in her calendar history. So that these women would not be missing 
from the aggregate variable, Most Severe, which represents the greatest degree of 
severity in any incident over each woman\'92s calendar history, we included a category of 
\'93forced sex only,\'94 which applied only when there was no other violent incident 
mentioned in the entire calendar.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Danger Assessment} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The Danger Assessment, an 18-item set of questions 
developed by Jacquelyn Campbell and designed to be used by a counselor or clinician 
to help an abused women think about the possible danger in her situation, was given to 
all interviewed women, at both the initial and the follow-up interviews, and to the proxy 
respondents. It was the last set of questions in the questionnaire (see Appendix II, 
Section N), and was introduced to the woman or proxy respondent as \'93a standard set of 
questions that are meant to help women decide about their current situation.\'94}{\plain \f1 \par

}{\plain \f1 \tab  By giving the Danger Assessment (DA) to both the AW and compari\-son 
samples, it was possible to take any instrumentation effect into account. However, for 
women interviewed as NAW, we did not ask the first seven DA questions, which all 
related to physical violence. In retrospect, it would have been better to have asked the 
NAW women questions 3 through 7, because they refer to abuse that ever happened, 
not just to abuse that happened in the past year. Many of the women interviewed as 
NAW had been abused by an intimate partner in previous years (see Screening 
Results, page 34 above). Unfortunately, we realized this only when data collection was 
half complete and it was too late to change.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Type of Union} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Women\'92s lives are often complicated. A simple interview question 
may not capture this complexity. Therefore, the CWHRS questionnaire provides several 
oppor\-tunities for a woman to tell us about her relationships and her abuser(s). First, she 
is asked her marital status, and then we define intimate partner and ask her questions 
about that person. If she has more than one intimate partner, we ask her to tell us about 
the one \'93you currently spend the most time with and feel closest to.\'94 Later in the ques\-
tion\-naire, after asking her a series of questions about any violence that may have 
happened at the hands of an intimate partner in the past year, we ask her to tell us 
about the person responsible for the most recent incidents. Finally, we asked whether 
that person had been responsible for all the incidents, and if not, we asked her to 
choose the abuser she wanted to talk about. For a maximum of three people, then, we 
asked each woman the following questions: whether the relationship was \'93current or 
former,\'94 \'93what is Name\'92s relationship to you?\'94, and the length of the relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research often uses marital status as an indicator of the type of relationship 
between individuals, with \'93ex\'94 or \'93former\'94 unions indicating an estranged relation\-ship, 
and \'93co-habitation\'94 indicating an intimate relationship in which the partners are not 
married. In the CWHRS, we found that these constructs did not accurately reflect 
women\'92s lives and relationships. A woman\'92s response to questions about her marital 
status does not necessarily describe her relationship with her closest intimate partner, 
and her relation\-ship with her closest intimate partner does not necessarily describe her 
relation\-ship with the intimate partner who is abusing her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, research on intimate partner violence that assumes that \'93marital 
status\'94 or \'93co-habitation\'94 reflects the relation\-ship with the abusing partner might well be 
misleading or incorrect. In addition, we found that it helped establish rapport when we 
asked women to tell us about the real circumstances of their lives, without forcing them 
into pre-determined categories. For example, a woman might tell us that her marital 
status is married, but then tell us that her closest intimate partner is not her husband, 
but a boyfriend, a same-sex partner, or a \'93current ex-boyfriend.\'94 An ex-boyfriend who is 
stalking the woman may not be the partner she \'93feels closest to.\'94{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 In addition, several women identified a person who had harmed her, but was not an intimate 
partner, for example, a father or a brother. In these cases, we added this information about 
violence against her to the calendar history, but we did not consider these instances to be \'93abuse 
by an intimate partner.\'94}}}
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A standard \'93marital status\'94 question (single, married, commonlaw marriage, sep\-
ar\-ated, divorced, widowed and other) was included in the CWHRS questionnaire, so 
that the findings may be compared to other research. However, we interpret the 
women\'92s answer to this question as an indicator of how she presents herself to the 
world, not as an accurate or complete description of her intimate partner circum\-stances.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though we realize that \'93commonlaw marriage\'94 is not a legal status in Illinois, we 
included it among the choices, in case there would be women who presented them\-
selves to the world in this way. In fact, a substantial proportion (18%) of the 159 Latina/Hispanic women in the sample described themselves as being in a commonlaw 
marriage (uni\'f3n libre), com\-pared to only one of the 467 African/American/Black women 
and one of the 66 white or other women. Thus, of the 31 women who said that their 
marital status was commonlaw marriage, 29 were Latina/Hispanic.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many women responded differently to the Marital Status item and to the 
immediately-following specific question about her intimate partner and her relationship 
with that person, which had the following lead-in language:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 Now I need to ask you some questions about your husband, boyfriend or 
girlfriend, sex partner or other intimate partner. By \'93intimate partner\'94 we 
mean a person you are or were romantically or sexually involved with, 
either currently or in the past year. If you have or had more than one 
intimate partner, please tell me about the one you currently spend the 
most time with and feel closest to.\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 This language was developed over many trials and drafts, and with considerable input 
from the multi-cultural Erie Advisory Group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Abusing Partner (Name, Name2, Name3)} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In Section J, we remind the woman of 
our definition of intimate partner, and ask her whether she has experienced any of 
eleven kinds of physical violence or violent threat by any intimate partner in the past 
year. If her answer is \'93yes\'94 to any of the incident types, we ask her whether the person 
\'93who did this to you\'94 is the same as the intimate partner she told us about earlier. If not, 
we ask who the responsible person was. Finally, we ask, \'93thinking about all of the 
incidents that occurred in the past year, was the person we have been talking about 
responsible for ALL of them?\'94  If her answer is \'93no,\'94 we ask her about these additional 
intimate partners and ask her to choose one partner to discuss for the remainder of the 
interview. We say the following:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 For the next series of questions, we need to pick just one of them to talk 
about. Please choose the person responsible for the MOST SERIOUS of 
the incidents we have been talking about, or the INCIDENT(S) THAT 
BOTHERED YOU THE MOST. Which person is that?\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 For the sake of privacy, we asked the woman to tell us how we should refer to this 
person for the rest of the interview. The person was identified as \'93Name\'94 in the 
question\-naire, but the interviewer substituted the woman\'92s name choice whenever 
\'93Name\'94 appeared.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, for the 208 women who interviewed as NAW, \'93Name\'94 is the partner she 
was \'93closest to\'94 at the time of the initial interview. For the 497 women who interviewed 
as AW, \'93Name\'94 is an intimate partner who was abusive in the past year, and who may 
not be the partner they were closest to. The follow-up interviews gathered information 
about Name over the one-year tracking period. During the first follow-up interview, the 
woman also had an oppor\-tun\-ity to discuss additional intimate partners responsible for 
violence against her, and to choose one of these as \'93Name2." At the second follow-up 
interview, she was asked about Name and Name2 (if any). And given an opportunity to 
discuss a third abusive intimate partner, \'93Name3.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Relationship and Co-Residence} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS interview asked separate 
questions about the woman\'92s relation\-ship and her living arrangements with Name. In 
addition to the semi-open-ended question describing the relationship with Name, we 
asked an extensive series of questions (Section D) about the people living in the 
woman\'92s household at the time of the initial interview. Of the 704 women who 
responded, 428 said they were not living with an intimate partner, and another eight 
women said that they were living with an intimate partner who was not Name (the 
abusive intimate partner). Thus, 436 (62%) were not living with their intimate partner 
(Name) at the time of the initial interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This, however, varied by the woman\'92s relationship with Name (Exhibit 17). Of the 
156 husbands, 124 (79%) were living in the same household with the woman, and of 
the 36 commonlaw husbands, 31 (86%) were living in the same household. However, 
only 10 of the 17 same-sex partners (59%) and 87 of the 339 boyfriends (26%) were 
living in the same household as the woman.\par

less likely to live in the same household with that partner (27% of ex-husbands, 15% of 
ex-commonlaw husbands, 6% of ex-boyfriends and half of the former same-sex 
partners). In addition, very few (12%) of the 33 women who used a different category to 
describe their relationship, such as friend, fianc\'e9 or child\'92s father, lived in the same 
household as Name.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the household \'93inventory\'94 questions, the CWHRS questionnaire 
included a series of detailed questions about the woman\'92s living arrangements with 
Name in the past year. Of the 697 women who responded, 37% said they were \'93living 
with\'94 Name at the time of the initial interview, and 27% had never lived in the same 
household as Name (Exhibit 18). Just as there were differences across racial/ethnic 
groups in women\'92s marital status, there were also differences in women\'92s living 
arrange\-ments with their intimate partner. It was much less common to have never lived 
with the Name for Latina/Hispanic women (11%) compared to African/American/Black 
women (32%) or white or other women (20%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, the CWHRS sample included many women who were experiencing 
violence at the hands of an intimate partner, but who were not \'93married to\'94 and had 
never \'93co-resided with\'94 that partner. These women would not have been included if the 
CWHRS sample had used marital status or co-residence as criteria for being in an 
intimate relation\-ship. Since questions about intimate relationships are sensitive, and 
because there are cultural and racial/ethnic differences in how women may describe 
these relation\-ships to a stranger such as an interviewer, we believe that it is very 
important to provide many opportunities for the woman to tell us about her relationship, 
and to avoid constraining language as much as possible. Otherwise, women in non-traditional intimate relation\-ships will be systematically excluded.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Estrangement and Leaving the Situation} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS design placed attempts to 
leave and estrangement in a context of lethal as well as sub\-le\-thal out\-comes, anchored 
with other occurrences in time, as one aspect of a total config\-ura\-tion of numer\-ous 
factors. The calendar history tracked estrange\-ment or leaving the relationship, including 
separation, threats to leave and relation\-ship termination during the profile year. In 
addition, women were asked detailed questions about whether they had left or tried to 
leave the abuser in the past year, the reasons they left or tried to leave, whether they 
returned, and their reasons for returning. The relevant dates for these events were 
entered into the calendar.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The questionnaire contains three major sources of information relevant to 
estrange\-ment: whether the woman said her relationship with her partner was current or 
former, her description of the relationship, and her answer to a series of questions 
about whether she or her partner had \'93left, or attempted to leave\'94 the relationship in the 
past year. In addition, in many semi-open-ended questions throughout the question\-
naire and in the calendar history, women were given opportunities to tell us about 
leaving the relationship. These questions received meticulous attention from those 
collabora\-tors who had experience working with women in domestic violence situations. 
We attempted to capture the complexity of each woman\'92s situation, without constraining 
her response to an overly simplistic set of questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For example, a woman might tell us that the relation\-ship is former, although 
Name may believe that it is current, and be using violence or harassment to force her to 
change her mind. Even though the relationship may have ended, the woman may still 
be in contact with Name. Especially when Name is \'93my child\'92s father,\'94 there are many 
opportun\-ities for continued contact in a relationship that has ended. A woman may have 
a new intimate partner while still being threatened or attacked by an ex-partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Only 17% of the 705 women interviewed in the CWHRS described the 
relationship with their intimate partner (Name) as an \'93ex\'94 type of relationship, including 
11 (2%) ex-husband, 13 (2%) ex-commonlaw husband, 94 (13%) ex-boyfriend, two 
(0.3%) ex-same-sex partner, and one each ex-friend and ex-fianc\'e9 (Exhibit 19). 
However, 242 women (34%) said that their relationship was former. Thus, it is important 
to look at the combin\-ation of both variables to get an accurate idea of the woman\'92s view 
of her relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women were asked a series of questions about whether or not they had 
attempted to leave the relationship or stayed away in the past year. (There was no 
question about any "break-up" that may have happened more than a year ago.) We first 
asked, \'93In the past year, did you leave or stay away from Name or ask Name to leave 
or stay away from you?\'94 If she said that she had, we asked when this had happened, 
so that the dates could be entered into the calendar history. We also asked a semi-open-ended question about her reasons for leaving or asking Name to leave, whether 
she had returned to the relationship, if so, when that had happened and her reasons for 
returning. Of the 699 women who responded, 291 (42%) had left in the past year 
(Exhibit 20).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This again demonstrates the necessity of asking women detailed questions 
about their relationship, and allowing a woman to give us responses in her own words. 
Of the 459 who said that their relationship was current, 197 (43%) had left or attempted 
to leave the relationship in the past year, and 14 of the women who said that their 
relationship was former had not left. Twelve of these 14 women had left Name over a 
year before the initial interview, though Name was still threatening or attacking them. In 
the other two cases, Name had left them. For example, one man had gone to work in 
Mexico a month before the interview.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Whether they interviewed as AW or NAW, }{\plain \f1 many women }{\plain \f1 were in the process of 
ending or beginning a relationship at the time of the interview, and it was not easy for 
them to us the exact date it had started and ended. Intimate relationships do not always 
have a definite beginning or ending date, but progress through \'93off and on\'94 stages over 
a period of time. There may be several "break-ups" before the final end to the 
relationship. In retrospect, we realized that our questions about length of the 
relationship and leaving the relationship had been confusing. We should have more 
clearly defined what we meant by \'93ended\'94 and \'93started.\'94 The concept of \'93ended\'94 was 
particularly confusing for women who had left or tried to end the relationship, but the 
partner was still trying to convince her to continue the relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For example, when a woman was in a former relation\-ship that had lasted over a 
year, we asked "How long had you been in this relation\-ship when it ended?" and then, 
"How long ago did it start?" However, the relationship may have started 20 years ago 
and ended five years ago, though the woman was still being stalked and attacked by 
the former partner. In this situation, the woman might say that the length of her 
relationship with Name had been 15 or 25 years, depending on her interpretation of the 
question. There were four interviews in which it could not be determined whether the 
woman meant to say \'93years since the beginning of the relationship to now\'94 or the 
\'93length of the relationship from the beginning to its end.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The relationship between the woman and Name had often lasted a significant 
period of time, whether the woman and her partner were living together or not at the 
time of the initial interview (Exhibit 21). Fewer than a fifth of the relationships had lasted 
12 months or less, and a third had lasted five or more years. We did not ask women to 
subtract time for any temporary breaks in the relation\-ship that may have occurred in 
previous years. We did, however, ask about leaving or attempting to leave the relation\-
ship, and returning to the relation\-ship, in the previous year (or since the last interview). 
This was not related to the length of the relationship (Exhibit 22).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Racial/Ethnic Group} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . An article by Jeff Mellow (1996), published just as the 
collaborators were developing the initial questionnaire, expressed the concern that 
many of us had about how to phrase our questions on race and ethnicity:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 The racial and ethnic identification of people has long been an integral 
part of criminal justice research and continues to this day to be a fre\-quent\-
ly used method for categorizing subjects. Unlike other social science 
varia\-bles, however, race and ethnicity are less rigorously measured.  .  .  .  
The same stringent standards researchers apply to other variables need 
to be applied to the race variable. . . .  A racial and ethnic classification 
system that pigeonholes entire segments of the population obfuscates 
true understanding.\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1  Most of the collaborators agreed with Mellow that racial categorizations are \'93invalid.\'94 
However, one of the goals of the project was to be sure that the sample included 
enough women of color so that we could examine whether or not high-risk factors for 
one group were different from high-risk factors for other groups. To do this, we had to 
have some measure of racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab After many discussions, drafts, and feedback from the Erie Advisory Group, we 
finally decided to ask an open-ended question, \'93How would you describe your race or 
ethnicity?\'94 The standard categories (see Exhibit 14, above) were included in the ques\-
tion\-naire, for the inter\-viewer to check, but the interviewers were instructed not to read 
the categories to the woman being interviewed. Almost all of the 703 women who 
responded gave an answer that corresponded with a standard Census category, but 
some gave us more specific answers (African/American/White from Nigeria; Creole, 
Mulatto) and a few (0.7%) refused or gave us answers such as Me, Poor, American, or 
Passionate.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Physical Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . For reasons of confidentiality, the collaborators decided not to 
seek access to the medical records of CWHRS women. Therefore, we needed to add 
self-report items on mental and physical health to the questionnaires. Recent research 
by Ferraro and Farmer (1999:303) shows, however, that \'93self-reported mor\-bid\-ity is 
equal or superior to physician-evaluated morbidity in a prognostic sense.\'94 In fact, for 
African/American/Black respondents, Ferraro and Farmer (1999) found that physician-evaluated morbidity was not related to either self-assessed health or to mortality.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS collaborators searched diligently and long for a \'93gold standard\'94 
pencil-and-paper inventory of physical and mental health status that would be brief 
enough to be included as one of the many indicators in our questionnaire, but failed to 
find one. In early drafts and tests of the questionnaire, we considered the Medical Out\-
comes Study (MOS) (Hays, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995; Stewart, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1988), the items used in the 
Canadian Violence Against Women Survey (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, 
1993), the items used in the National Violence Against Women Survey in the United 
States (Tjaden, 1996), and others (see McDowell & Newell, 1996). All of these were too 
long, detailed and time-consuming for our purposes. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the end, the CWHRS developed a combination of general questions on 
physical and mental health from the MOS, and open-ended questions about the specific 
physical or mental condition(s) that \'93limits you\'94 (see Section E of the Initial Question\-
naire, Appendix II). These questions begin with a five-point scale rating of \'93general 
health\'94 followed by a comparison to \'93a year ago,\'94 and include a question about health 
care visits in the past year, an item rating the degree to which health problems had 
interfered with \'93normal social activities\'94 in the past month, two questions rating bodily 
pain in the past month, and a series of six semi-structured questions about any physical 
or mental condi\-tion that may have limited R in the past month. There were probes for 
specific dates, so that any health changes could be noted in the calendar history.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Following the example of Kington, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1997) and Hays, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1995), we 
developed two scales based on answers to the MOS questions. The General Health 
Perceptions scale was based on four questions (E1, E2, E3 and E11 in the initial ques\-
tion\-naire), each in a five-point ordinal scale. The Health Functioning scale was based 
on questions about whether physical or emotional health problems interfered with or 
limited R in her daily activity in the past year (E4, E7, E10, and E12). E4 and E7 were 
dichoto\-mies (yes or no choices), and E10 and E12 were on a five-point ordinal scale. 
To create the Health Functioning scale, we recoded questions E10 (interference of 
physical or emotional problems) and E12 (interference of pain) into dichotomies as well, 
with all positive answers from \'93a little of the time\'94 to \'93all of the time\'94 counting as \'93yes\'94 
and other answers counting as \'93no.\'94 We then summed the \'93yes\'94 responses across the 
four questions. This produced a scale ranging from 0 (not limited) to 4 (limited). To 
score a 3 or 4 on this scale, a woman had to respond that she was limited in both 
physical and mental health.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Pregnancy} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Keeping in mind the methodological problems in measuring preg\-
nancy and abuse (Ballard, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998; Petersen, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998), the CWHRS attempted 
to access the woman\'92s pregnancy and pregnancy outcome(s) at every point during the 
calendar year. Within the \'93health\'94 section of the questionnaire, we asked each woman 
whether she was pregnant now or in the past year, and then asked her for her due date 
if she was pregnant now and the date the pregnancy ended if she had been pregnant in 
the past year. For women who had been pregnant, we ask them \'93the outcome of that 
pregnancy,\'94 and read four choices: live birth, miscarriage, abortion and stillbirth. Of the 
705 inter\-viewed women, 127 women who told us that they had been pregnant in the 
past year, and only one of the 127 did not tell us about the outcome of the pregnancy 
(90 live births, 22 miscarriages and 14 abortions).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the \'93household\'94 section of the questionnaire, an inventory of 
everyone living with the woman, asked her if there had been any change in the past 
year, such as \'93a new baby born,\'94 and if so, the date that happened. This date was 
added to the calendar. In the section about Name, the woman was asked whether or 
not she has had any children with Name, and where these children are living. One of 
the Danger Assessment questions asks the woman if Name had ever \'93beaten you while 
you are pregnant.\'94 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Drug and Alcohol Use} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Instruments intended to assess the risk of lethal outcome 
in intimate partner violence often include alcohol use. Hart's (1988) list, based on 
clinical experi\-ence, includes drug or alcohol consumption, Straus\'92s (1991) list, based on 
the 1985 National Family Vio\-lence Survey, includes whether the abuser drunk more 
than three times a year or abused drugs in the past year, and the Danger Assessment 
(DA), a forced choice 15-item question\-naire designed to be completed by a 
professional working with battered women (Campbell, 1986, 1992), includes questions 
about the partner\'92s drug use and whether he is drunk \'93almost every day.\'94\par
\tab The CWHRS initial questionnaire, in the section on physical and mental health, 
contained a series of six questions about the woman\'92s alcohol and drug use, introduced 
by, \'93Have you ever had a problem with alcohol?\'94 or \'93Have you ever had a problem with 
drugs? By drugs, I mean \'91uppers\'92 or amphetamines, speed, angel dust, cocaine, \'91crack,\'92 
street drugs or mixtures.\'94 A \'93yes\'94 response to this first question was followed by asking 
\'93Is this currently a problem for you?\'94 and \'93Did you ever receive treatment for this 
problem?\'94 The only questions about the intimate partner\'92s use of alcohol or drugs were 
in the Danger Assessment section. We asked, \'93Does (name) use drugs? By drugs, I 
mean \'91uppers\'92 or amphetamines, speed, angel dust, cocaine, \'91crack,\'92 street drugs or 
mixtures,\'94 and \'93In your opinion, does (name) now have or ever had an alcohol 
problem?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because we were concerned about having enough detail about alcohol and drug 
use so that CWHRS results would be comparable to other research, and because the 
initial interview required less time than it had in the pilot study, we added more detailed 
questions to the first and second follow-up questionnaires (Appendix II). Instead of the 
six questions asked in the initial interview, we substituted a series of nine questions, a 
shortened form of the questions used by the National Alcohol and Family Violence 
Survey (Kaufman-Kantor, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1994). These consist of sets of questions on alcohol, 
marijuana and other drugs, beginning with, \'93During the last month, how often did you 
[drink alcohol/ use marijuana/ use drugs], on average.\'94 The alcohol question was 
followed by asking about the number of drinks the woman had on a typical day. A 
follow-up ques\-tion specifying any special days when she drinks or uses drugs, for 
example weekends or paydays, was intended to capture information corresponding to 
the calendar history. Finally, we ask about treatment for an alcohol or drug problem 
\'93since the last interview.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A series of seven questions, similar to the questions asked about the woman, 
were asked about the alcohol or drug use of Name, Name2 and Name3 in the two 
follow-up interviews. (In the first follow-up, see items C12 to C18 about Name and items 
L21 to L27 about Name2). We continued to ask the two Danger Assessment ques\-tions 
about alcohol and drugs.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the questions in the questionnaire, we asked about alcohol or drug 
involvement in the calendar history. For each incident mentioned, we asked, \'93Were you 
or Name drunk during the incident?\'94, \'93Were you or Name high on marijuana during the 
incident?\'94 and \'93Were you or Name using other drugs, such as cocaine, crack, heroin or 
speed during the incident?\'94 Finally, for women who interviewed as AW, in the help-seeking and inter\-vention section (Section M of the initial questionnaire), there are also 
some questions about alcohol and drug abuse treatment or counseling, on the part of 
the woman and Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Mental Health: PTSD} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The Women\'92s Health Risk Study interview instrument 
used a 17-question tool (Section K in the initial interview; see Appendix II) to analyze 
post\-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This tool is called the PTSD Symptom Scale 
(PSS-I) Foa }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1993). The questions are based on 17 criteria used to define PTSD 
in the DSM III-R. These questions are divided into three criteria: four items relate to 
intrusive or re-experiencing symptoms, seven to avoidance symptoms, and six items to 
arousal symptoms. PTSD diag\-nosis requires the presence of six or more of these 
symptoms \'96 at least one of the four intrusive or re-experiencing items, three of the 
seven avoidance items, and two of the six arousal items.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In a study done by}{\plain \f1  Foa }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1993)}{\plain \f1 , the Cronbach\'92s Alpha for the entire scale 
was 0.85. Alpha coefficients for the symptom cluster subscales were reexperiencing 
0.69, avoidance 0.65, arousal 0.71. The test retest correlation for the entire scale was 
found to be r(93) = 0.80, p<.001. While for the subscales it was reexperiencing 0.66, 
avoidance 0.76, and arousal 0.77. Interrater reliability was found to have a Kappa 
coefficient for the diagnosis of PTSD of 0.91. Sensitivity was found to be 88% while 
specificity was 96%. Overall, the PSS-I correctly identified PTSD status of 94% of the 
subjects.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are two important considerations in measuring PTSD. First, PTSD is 
properly a clinical assessment, should be administered by a psychologist, and no series 
of questions in a questionnaire can provide a definitive measure. This constraint applies 
to the tool used in the CWHRS questionnaires, as it does to any other question\-naire 
assessment of PTSD. None of them is a substitute for a clinician\'92s detailed interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The second consideration is that PTSD is not defined merely by a group of 
symptoms, but rather by the relation of these symptoms to a specific traumatic event or 
group of events (Davidson & Foa, 1991). Further, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD were 
developed for people who had experienced a single traumatic event, and may not apply 
so closely to the continuing aspects of intimate partner violence (Herman, 1992118-122). There\-fore, the PTSD section of the question\-naire immediately follows Sections H 
and J, in which women are asked about incidents of harassment and physical attack in 
the previous year. For the women who answered \'93yes\'94 to any item in H or J, we 
introduce the PTSD questions by saying,\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 Many women find that these kinds of incidents are stressful. Thinking 
about the incidents that we just talked about, please tell me if you have 
been bothered by any of the following DURING THE PAST MONTH.\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 For the women who answered \'93no\'94 to every H and J question and who therefore inter\-
viewed as NAW, it was difficult to decide how to gather comparable information on 
PTSD. After considering many alternative solutions, the collaborators decided to use 
the following introduction to the PTSD section for the NAW women,\par
}\pard \fi-720\li720\ri720\tx720 
{\plain \f1  \tab Below is a list of problems or complaints that people sometimes have in 
response to stressful life experiences, such as car accidents, death or 
serious illness in the family, or loss of a job. Thinking about a stressful 
event that may have happened to you, please tell me if you have been 
bothered by any of the following DURING THE PAST MONTH.\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, of the 690 women who responded, the Cronbach\'92s Alpha (stand\-
ard\-ized item alpha) was .7908 for the re-experiencing items, .8311 for the arousal 
items, and .8318 for the avoidance items. For the entire 17 items, Cronbach\'92s standard\-
ized item Alpha was .9184. This is somewhat higher than the alpha obtained by Foa, }{\plain \i\f1 et 
al}{\plain \f1 . (1993), which was .85 for the entire scale. Reliability of the total scale was high 
across racial/ethnic groups. It was .9213 for African/American/Black women, .9038 for 
Latina/Hispanic women, and .9138 for white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 690 women, 53% had a PTSD diagnosis, and 13% answered \'93yes\'94 on 16 
or 17 of the PTSD items. The 153 Latina/Hispanic women were more likely (65%) to 
have a PTSD diagnosis than African/American/Black women (50%) or white or other 
women (58%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Mental Health: Depression and Suicidal Feelings} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . As an indicator of depression, 
we used four items from the MOS asking the woman to tell us about how she felt 
\'93during the past month\'94 (Section E , questions 21, 22, 23 and 24). Each item required a 
rating on a five-point Likert scale from \'93none of the time\'94 to \'93all of the time.\'94 They 
included feeling \'93down\-hearted and blue,\'94 \'93so down in the dumps that nothing could 
cheer you up,\'94 being \'93a happy person,\'94 and feeling \'93calm and peaceful.\'94 One of the 705 
women interviewed in the clinic/hospital sample had to leave before reaching that 
section, and did not answer any of the four questions. The other 704 women answered 
all four questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Cronbach\'92s Alpha for the Depressed Feelings scale, a summary variable 
created from these four items, which totals whether the woman answered \'93most of the 
time\'94 or \'93all of the time\'94 to the two negative questions, and whether the woman 
answered \'93none of the time\'94 or \'93a little of the time\'94 to the two positive questions, was 
\_.6817. Of the 704 women who answered, 303 (43%) had zero \'93depressed\'94 responses 
to these four items, while 68 women (10%) had four \'93depressed\'94 responses.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A second indicator of depression was taken from women\'92s answers to a question 
about their health \'93during the past month,\'94 in which they were asked, \'93have you been 
limited in the amount or kind of activity you can do at home, at work or at school 
because of an emotional condition, such as depression, nervousness or panic attacks?\'94 
Of the 262 women (37%) who said \'93yes,\'94 194 (74%) mentioned \'93depression\'94 in 
response to the follow-up question, \'93What is the main emotional condition that limits 
you?\'94 Whether or not the woman mentioned depression was correlated moderately with 
each of the four items capturing depressed feelings, specifically (.415 with \'93feeling 
blue,\'94 .377 with\'93feeling down,\'94  -.387 with \'93being happy,\'94 and -.341 with \'93feeling calm\'94), 
and .434 with the summary Depressed Feelings scale. These correlations and the 
Cronbach Alpha results were similar within each of the three racial/ethnic groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were 32 women who scored \'930" on the Depressed Feelings scale, but who 
mentioned depression as an emotional condition that bothered them. Most of these 
women scored \'930" because they said that they were depressed only \'93some\'94 of the time 
and happy \'93most\'94 of the time. However, many of them also said that they were 
\'93bothered by an emotional condition,\'94 which they identified as depression, \'93all\'94 or \'93most\'94 
of the time. Therefore, we created a second summary indicator of depressed feelings, 
which includes whether or not the woman told us that she was bothered by depression. 
The Depressed Feelings II scale ranges from zero to five. A woman scored five if she 
answered \'93all\'94 or \'93most\'94 of the time to both negative questions, \'93none\'94 or \'93a little\'94 of the 
time to both positive questions, and mentioned depression as an emotional condition.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A third indicator of depression was one of the Danger Assessment questions 
(N14), \'93Have you ever threatened or tried to commit suicide?\'94 A positive answer to this 
question is correlated moderately with whether the woman mentioned \'93depression\'94 as a 
emotional condition bothering her in the past month (.309) and with the Depressed 
Feelings scale (.300). It is correlated somewhat less with feeling blue (.297), feeling 
down in the dumps (.294), being happy (-.281) and feeling calm (-.219).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were 41 women who said that they had \'93ever\'94 threatened or tried to 
commit suicide, but who scored zero on the Depressed Feelings II scale. There could 
be several reasons for this. First, N14 asks whether the woman had \'93ever\'94 threatened 
or attempted suicide, and the Depressed Feelings ques\-tions refer to how she had been 
feeling in the last month. Second, since the Depressed Feelings questions come at the 
beginning of the questionnaire and the suicide question comes at the end of the 
question\-naire, it is possible that women felt more comfortable with their interviewer and 
more able to answer such a sensitive question by the end of the interview period. Since 
we do not know which was the case, we analyzed the suicide question separately from 
the Depressed Feelings scales.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Partner\'92s Physical and Mental Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Other than alcohol or drug use and treat\-
ment, there is little in the CWHRS questionnaires about the abusive partner(s)\'92s 
physical health. There is one question about suicide, \'93Has (name) ever threatened or 
tried to commit suicide?\'94 in the Danger Assessment.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Occupation and Income} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The primary intention of the questions on occupation 
and income in the CWHRS was to find out about the resources a woman might have 
that would help her deal with abusive situations. Socioeconomic categorization was 
only a secondary goal. Thus, the collaborators phrased the occupation question 
(Section B, initial questionnaire) to tap the degree to which the woman had contacts 
outside of the home on a regular basis. The income questions were placed at the end 
of the other social support network questions (Section F, initial questionnaire). We were 
most interested in knowing whether or not the woman had a source of funds that she 
herself controlled. Therefore, we used the following introduction:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 One important source of support, for many women, is the amount of 
money they have that is under their own name, or that they can control. 
This might include income from a job outside the home or from working at 
home, help from family, assistance from AFDC or Disability, or any other 
kind of income. Do you have money or income of your own that you 
control?\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 \tab This wording produced very few refusals; 695 of the 705 women responded to 
the question about their personal income. In addition, it produced three separate 
measures -- whether the woman has any personal source of income (an indicator of her 
resources), the amount of her personal income, and her household income (for 
comparison with other populations).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Immigrant Status and Public Aid} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The academic researchers among the collabor\-
a\-tors thought it was important to include specific questions about immigrant status (for 
example, \'93are you a U.S. citizen?\'94 and \'93do you have a green card?\'94) and whether or not 
the woman was receiving public assistance. Although we developed and tested sets of 
questions covering both kinds of information, in the end we decided to remove these 
questions from the questionnaires. The advocates and community workers among the 
collaborators made a strong case against it. They pointed out that immigration status is 
an extremely sensitive issue among immigrant populations, and public assistance is an 
extremely sensitive issue among public aid recipients. If we included either sort of ques\-
tion, they reasoned, we would not receive candid answers. I\-n addition, such questions 
might make the woman suspicious of us, so that she would either end the inter\-view or 
become reticent about what she would tell us in answer to later questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We decided, therefore, that the possible advantages of including such questions 
would be more than overshadowed by the possible disadvantages. We think that this 
decision, in combination with many other ways in which we strove to make the ques\-
tion\-naire and the interview process culturally sensitive, was in part responsible for the 
high degree of cooperation we received from the women we interviewed. Only five of 
the 705 women failed to complete the interview, usually because of time constraints 
involving their children or their doctor\'92s appointment, and most questionnaire items had 
very few missing responses.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although the questionnaire contains no direct question about immigrant status or 
public assistance, there were a number of opportunities for women to mention these 
issues. While these questions do not allow us to categorize all of the women according 
to their immigrant or public aid status, they do tap information that was more central to 
the purpose of the CWHRS -- they let us know if either of these issues was a factor in 
the abusive relationship, or a deterrent in the woman\'92s help-seeking activities. In 
Section F of the initial questionnaire, we asked whether, \'93I hesitate to tell anyone about 
my problems because I am worried that the authorities, like DCFS or immigration, may 
find out,\'94 and in the open-ended responses to why she \'93decided not to contact\'94 an 
agency, doctor or the police, women could cite \'93fear of immigration authorities.\'94 The 
questionnaire also contains many related questions, such as birthplace, whether the 
interview was in Spanish or English, \'93How long have you been living in Chicago or the 
Chicago area?\'94, whether the woman agrees that, \'93It is difficult for me to ask for help 
because people don\'92t always speak my language,\'94 and whether the woman mentions a 
\'93language barrier\'94 as a reason that she decided not to seek help.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Resources and Social Support Network} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The collaborators critically assessed a 
number of measures of Helping Network based on the Arizona Social Support Interview 
Sche\-dule (ASSIS), including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social support 
(MSPSS) (Zimet, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1988). We decided that these measures were too long and 
cumber\-some to be used as one component of a long interview. (Again, in order to meet 
our goal that high-risk but under served women would not be excluded from the study, it 
was important to keep any obstacles of participation to a minimum. One such obstacle 
is the length of the inter\-view.) In addition to the length of the ASSIS, however, the 
collabor\-ators questioned its relevance to this population. In response to these 
problems, several collaborators worked together to develop a Social Support Network 
scale, consisting of 12 items (Exhibit 23). The Social Support Network scale had a 
reliability coefficient Alpha= .8359, which is consistently high for women in all three 
racial/ethnic groups, .8087 for African/American/Black women, .8474 for 
Latina/Hispanic women, and .8568 for white or other women. \par

\tab Of the 705 women, 687 (97%) answered all 12 SSN items, 13 women (2%) 
answered all but one item, three women answered seven, eight or ten items, and two 
did not answer any of the 12 SSN items. The mean number of answers in the \'93support\'94 
direction was 9.13 of the twelve items, the median was 10.0 and the mode was 12.0. 
Using factor analysis, we developed three sub-scales from the twelve support network 
items: access to and knowledge of resources (items 3, 10 and 11 in Exhibit 23, above), 
tangible help in emergencies (items 6, 8, 12 and 13), and acceptance and support 
(items 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7).\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 703 women who responded to any SSN question, 700 (99%) responded 
to all five \'93Acceptance and Support\'94 questions, and three responded to four.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 One woman responded to the questions by saying that \'93Only God\'94 was there for her. For the 
Acceptance and Support subscale, we counted these answers as a no.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Similarly, 
696 responded to all four \'93Emergency Help\'94 questions, and six responded to three. One 
answered only one question, and was dropped from the Emergency Help subscale. Of 
the 703, 698 responded to all three \'93Access to Resources\'94 questions, and two women 
responded to two of the three. One woman refused all three questions, and was 
dropped from the Access to Resources subscale.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the pilot study, we had found that some women interpreted item F3 to mean 
that the people they might ask for help could not understand \'93where I am coming from.\'94 
A follow-up probe was added to the questionnaire to distinguish between this kind of 
communica\-tion difficulty and language barriers. The Social Support Network scale uses 
the language barrier definition of this question.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are slight differences in the score on the Social Support Network scale 
across racial/ethnic groups, with African/American/Black women scoring somewhat 
higher than others on average (Exhibit 24). Of the 465 African/American/Black women 
who responded, 310 (67%) said that they had at least ten areas of support, compared 
to 62 of the 159 (39%) Latina/Hispanic women and 32 of the 66 (48%) white or other 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a large and significant (t test p < .0001) difference between the mean 
SSN scores of women who said they had (9.49) or did not have (5.53) a safe place to 
go, and this difference applied to women of each racial/ethnic group. On the other 
hand, the relation\-ship between the woman\'92s score on the Social Support Network scale 
and other indicators of her resources was not always simple (Exhibit 25).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many of these other indicators of her resources are related to the SSN score 
only for a particular group of women. Whether the woman interviewed in Spanish or 
English seemed to be related to SSN score for the entire group of CWHRS women. 
However, since only two women who were not Latina/Hispanic were interviewed in 
Spanish, the appropriate comparison is for Latina/Hispanic women only. The mean 
SSN score was significantly (t test p = .010) related to the interview language for the 
Latina/Hispanic women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the same way, almost all of the African/American/Black and white or other 
women had lived in Chicago for many years, so the question only applied to the Latina/Hispanic women. The same is true for the women who were homeless or living in a 
group home, except that this question applied only to African/American/Black women, 
for whom the difference between the average SSN score for women who were home\-
less or in a group home versus women who were not was significant at the .0001 level.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab  Latina/Hispanic women who said that divorce was acceptable in her family had 
a higher average SSN score than women who said it was unacceptable (t test p = 
.033), but for African/American/Black women and for white or other women, there was a 
slight and non-significant tendency in the opposite direction. For the entire sample, 
there was a significant relation\-ship between whether the woman had a personal income 
that she controlled herself and her mean SSN score (t test p = .001). However, the 
relationship was nonexistent for African/American/Black women, small and 
nonsignificant for Latina/Hispanic women, and strong and significant (t test p = .004) for 
white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Stalking and Other Harassment} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS uses the HARASS (Harass\-ment in 
Abusive Relation\-ships: A Self-Report Scale) instru\-ment, developed by Daniel Sheridan, 
and tested and refined for this study by Daniel Sheridan, Richard Tolman, and other 
collaborators. The 19 HARASS items have a reliability coefficient of Alpha= .855. The 
mean HARASS score for the total sample was 4.23 of the 19 questions (Exhibit 26). 
The CWHRS African/American/Black women had a significantly (t test p <.0001) higher 
average score on HARASS (4.59), compared to the average score for the Latina/Hispanic women (3.29). The average score for the white or other women (3.92) was 
also lower than for the African/American/Black women 4.59, but the difference was not 
statistically significant. The HARASS scale provides a reliable measure of harassment 
and stalking for each of the three racial/ethnic groups. The Alpha reliability coefficient 
for HARASS was .8704 for African/American/Black women, .8752 for Latina/Hispanic 
women, and .8769 for white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab With 19 items, it is possible that HARASS actually contains several sub-scales. 
To check for this, we ran a factor analysis (principal component analysis), which found 
five components of the 19 HARASS items. These components are shown in Exhibit 26, 
with the \'93factor loadings\'94 of each item within the given component. The higher the factor 
loading, the more strongly the item was linked to the other items in the component. We 
gave names to each component, reflecting what the combination of items seemed to 
measure. Some of these sets of items do seem to have a logical consistency, such as 
the nine items in the component we have called \'93Violent Stalking.\'94 However, the Alpha 
coefficient of the nine \'93Violent Stalking\'94 items was only .8401, which is not an improve\-
ment on the Alpha of the total HARASS scale. Also, the Alpha coefficient of the \'93Violent 
Threats\'94 component was only .4573. Therefore, we decided that the total HARASS 
scale would be a better measure to use, rather than any separate component of it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Controlling Behavior} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The five-item \'93Power and Control\'94 scale from the }{\plain \i\f1 Violence 
Against Women}{\plain \f1  survey was adminis\-tered in the initial and follow-up clinic/hospital inter\-
views and the proxy interviews (Exhibit 27). Tested in a nationwide survey in Canada, it 
is similar to the Con\-trol\-ling Be\-haviors Index and the Tolman indices, with the advantage 
of being short\-er. The reliability coefficient Alpha is .8164. Almost all of the 705 women 
interviewed answered all five questions, except that the question about \'93shared family 
income\'94 was not applicable to 66 women (9.4%) who did not share a house\-hold income 
with an intimate partner. This was significantly (Chi square p = .013) more likely to be 
true for African/American/Black women (11.6%) than for Latina/Hispanic women (3.8%) 
or for white or other women (7.7%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS women were fairly equally distributed across the six Power and 
Control categories, from 17% who had no \'93yes\'94 response, to 25% who answered \'93yes\'94 
to all five items. There was no relationship between the woman\'92s racial/ethnic group 
and her score on the Power and Control scale (Exhibit 28). However, there was a 
difference for one of the individual questions. African/American/Black women were 
significantly more likely to say that their partner was jealous, with 75% of them 
answering \'93yes\'94 to that question, compared to 59% of Latina/Hispanic women (t = 
\_3.974; p <.0001) and 54 of white or other women (t = -3.668; p < .0001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a relationship between HARASS and the Power and Control scale 
(Exhibit 29). The mean HARASS score for women who scored \'93zero\'94 on the Power and 
Control scale was only 0.55, com\-pared to 8.16 for women who answered \'93yes\'94 to all 
five questions. The correlation between the two is .721 (p < .0001). The four individual 
Power and Control items are also significantly correlated with the total HARASS score. 
The correlation with the \'93jealous\'94 item was .761; it was .810 with the \'93limit control\'94 item; 
it was .777 with the \'93knowing where you are\'94 item; it was .758 with the \'93called you 
names\'94 item; and it was .683 with the \'93family income\'94 item. Even though the woman\'92s 
score on HARASS and her score on the Power and Control scale were strongly 
correlated with each other (Pearson r = .721, p <.01), they were not always correlated 
in the same way with the other key variables measured in the CWHRS (Exhibit 30).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Women with a higher household income or a higher personal income tended to 
have a lower score on the Power and Control scale, but there was no association with 
the HARASS score. In addition, women who said they had a safe place where they 
could go tended to have a lower Power and Control score, but there was no correlation 
with the HARASS score. The Power and Control score and the HARASS score were 
related in the same way to most other factors, however.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the Power and Control scale, two of the Danger Assessment (DA) 
questions, asked at the very end of the interview, were related to the partner\'92s 
controlling behavior. These questions were, \'93Is your partner violently and constantly 
jealous of you?\'94 and \'93Does your partner control most of your daily activities?\'94 
Unfortunately, these two questions were asked only of women who had interviewed as 
AW. For these women, however, there was a close association between the answers to 
these questions and answers to the Power and Control and HARASS questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a strong, though not perfect, association between women answering 
\'93yes\'94 to the Power and Control jealousy question and answering \'93yes\'94 to the DA 
jealousy question (Gamma = .870; p <.0001). Of the 411 women who answered \'93yes\'94 to 
the Power and Control question, 96% also answered \'93yes\'94 to the DA question, and of 
the 77 women who answered \'93no\'94 to the Power and Control scale question, 86% 
answered \'93no\'94 to the DA question. In addition, women who answered \'93yes\'94 to the DA 
jealousy question were much more likely to score 5 out of 5 on the Power and Control 
scale (46% versus 17%), and the mean score on the HARASS scale was 7.18, 
compared to 3.11 for women who answered \'93no\'94 (t test p <.0001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the same way, women who answered \'93yes\'94 to the DA question, \'93Does your 
partner control most of your daily activities?\'94 had higher mean scores on HARASS 
(7.06) compared to women who answered \'93no\'94 (3.29), and the difference was 
significant (t test p < .0001). Of the 300 women who said \'93yes,\'94 51% scored 5 out of 5 
on the Power and Control scale, compared to 8% of the 190 women who said \'93no.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ulw\f1 Intervention and Help-Seeking} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Women who interviewed as AW were asked 
about help-seeking and intervention in the past year. The advocates, counselors and 
helping professionals among the collaborators were extremely active in developing and 
editing these questions. The main concerns were that the questions be sensitive to 
women in many different situations and from many different backgrounds, that the 
ques\-tions allow her to tell about complex experiences, and that the questions \'93permit\'94 a 
woman to say that she had not sought help, and to tell us why, without implying that 
she was at fault. The following lead-in language to this section was important in 
establishing this rapport:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 When incidents like these happen, sometimes women get help or advice 
from a friend, sometimes they call an agency or counselor, and 
sometimes they contact a medical center or the police. On the other hand, 
sometimes they decide it is best not to contact anyone. I am going to 
describe some of these possibilities, and I would like you to tell me if you 
ever did any of these things in the past year.\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 Because of time constraints, we did not ask about help-seeking activity after each 
specific incident. Instead, we followed the calendar history with a series of questions 
about things that happened \'93ever\'94 in the past year. We did not, for example, ask 
whether the police had been notified after each incident, but asked only, \'93Did you 
contact the police after any of these incidents in the past year?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are several differences between help-seeking information in the CWHRS 
and many other studies of arrest, medical care, counseling, or other intervention. First, 
the CWHRS was not designed to be a controlled experi\-ment, such as Sherman\'92s 
(1992)}{\plain \f1  research}{\plain \f1  on the effect of arrest. Instead, it was designed to provide information 
about the woman\'92s experience with help-seeking, and to provide information about 
cases in which the woman did not seek help or in which the woman sought help but did 
not receive it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For example, we can compare cases in which the police were called to cases in 
which the police were }{\plain \i\f1 never}{\plain \f1  notified (whether by the woman or by someone else). Such 
cases are not typically included in domes\-\-tic vio\-lence arrest experi\-ments. Second, the 
proxy respondent interviews provide comparable information about the woman\'92s experi\-
ence with help-seeking in the past year, in cases in which one of the partners was killed 
by the other.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Third, the CWHRS was designed to include many kinds of help-seeking, both 
formal and informal, and to provide oppor\-tun\-ities for the woman to tell us about other 
kinds of interventions she might have tried, whether listed on the ques\-tionnaire or not. 
Fourth, the CWHRS was designed to let a woman tell us about her reasons for seeking 
help or not seeking help after a particu\-lar incident, and about the results of the 
intervention, from her perspective. Finally, the CWHRS was designed to place help-seeking in a multi\-variate context with other events and circum\-stances of a woman\'92s life.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The questionnaire included questions about four general areas of help-seeking 
and interven\-tion. First, we asked if she had ever \'93talked things over with someone you 
know\'94 in the past year; if not, \'93what were your reasons,\'94 and if so, \'93who did you talk 
with?\'94 and \'93was it ever helpful?\'94 This was followed by a set of questions about helping 
agencies: \'93Sometimes women contact an agency or counselor when an incident like 
this happens. Did you contact an agency or coun\-selor in the past year?\'94 These had the 
same follow-up questions about reasons for not contacting a counselor, or the 
helpfulness of the counselor, and also included specific questions about the type of 
counseling or treat\-ment that she or her abusive partner had received.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Third, the questionnaire includes two sets of medical help-seeking questions: 
\'93Did you contact or visit a doctor or a medical center after any of these (this) incident(s) 
in the past year?\'94 followed by her reasons for contacting them or not. If the woman said 
that she had contacted them at least sometimes, we asked, \'93When you got medical 
help, did someone ever ask you about the beating?\'94 and if so, \'93Did you tell them about 
what happened?\'94 Again, we asked the woman to tell us her reasons for telling or not 
telling. If she did tell them, we asked what they did and whether or not it was ever 
helpful.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Fourth, each woman was asked whether she or anyone else contacted the 
police in any incident. The lead-in question was, \'93Sometimes women contact the police 
when something like this happens. Did you contact the police after any of these 
incidents in the past year?\'94 The possible responses were \'93yes,\'94 \'93no\'94 and \'93sometimes\'94 
(when the women had called the police after some incidents but not others). All except 
one of the 493 women who com\-pleted the calendar history answered this question. 
Four women said that some\-one else had contacted the police for her. If the police were 
called, we asked what they did and whether it was helpful. If the woman said that she 
had not contacted the police in the past year, we asked, \'93When you decided not to 
contact the police, what were your reasons?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We ended the help-seeking questions by asking each woman about anything 
else she may have done in the past year, and whether it was helpful:\par
}\pard \li720\ri720 
{\plain \f1 Sometimes women do something else to try to help themselves after 
something like this happens. Did you do something that we have not 
mentioned so far after any of the incidents in the past year?\par
}\pard 
{\plain \f1 \tab The woman was also asked whether she went to court for \'93something related to 
these incidents,\'94 and if so, what was the outcome of the case. Outcomes included an 
order of protection. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, we included a number of general questions about help-seeking and 
intervention at the end of this section. We asked each woman if there was \'93someplace 
you can go where you feel safe\'94 and if so, where that place was. We asked a series of 
questions about whether she had gone to court in the past year \'93for something related 
to these incidents,\'94 and the kind of court outcome including an Order of Protection. We 
asked a series of questions about the type of counseling or treatment that Name might 
have received. We asked whether there was \'93anything you needed from the police, 
agencies, or medical providers that you did not get.\'94 The last question was, \'93From your 
experience, what advice would you give another women living in a similar situation?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
{\tc {}{\plain \b\f1 Initial Interview Methods} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The initial interviews took place in a private and secure room, with a closed door, 
at the hospital, clinic or health center. After giving informed writ\-ten consent (Appendix 
III), each woman was asked to complete the initial ques\-tion\-naire (Appendix II) in a face-to-face interview conducted in a secure and private setting. Each woman received a 
$10 incentive fee at the initial interview and $20 for each follow-up interview, plus 
transportation expenses if needed. We told women that they would receive the 
incentive fee even if they felt that, for some reason, they could not complete the 
interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each interviewed woman signed two consent forms (see Appendix III), both of 
which stressed the confidentiality of the study. The first form was completed at the point 
at which the woman had been screened at intake, and was then being asked if she 
would like to talk to an interviewer about the possibility of being part of a study. The 
second form was completed at the beginning of the interview. In addition, the woman 
was repeatedly reminded at several points throughout the interview of the confiden\-tiality 
of the findings. Although we never asked about child abuse in the interview, we 
reminded the woman that if she did spontaneously mention that a child is being abused, 
we would need to tell the hospital/clinic staff. But we did say that we could refer her to a 
counselor if she wanted to talk about that issue.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As a safety issue, we reminded her that the medical staff would never find out 
about what she told us, unless she told them herself. So, in case a woman might have 
thought that she had told someone at the hospital or clinic about the abuse by telling 
us, we pointed out to her that her assumption was not true.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab During the process of coding the initial interview and tracking women for the 
follow-up interview, we discovered that we had done nine duplicate initial interviews. 
Most of these were done at the Cook County Hospital walk-in clinic, when women who 
needed the $10 respon\-dent fee put themselves in a position to be re-screened and re-inter\-viewed. Three of these women, interviewed twice each in December, 1997, have 
not been found again for a follow-up. An additional \'93duplicate\'94 initial interview, done five 
months afterwards, was used as a first follow-up. In two duplicate interviews, both 
conducted some months after the initial interview, the woman told the interviewer about 
physical abuse that she had not mentioned in the earlier interview. We decided to 
change each of these women from the comparison to the abused sample, to treat the 
later interview as the initial interview, and to conduct further follow-up interviews.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In several cases, the additional calendar information obtained in a \'93duplicate\'94 
interview conducted several months after the initial interview provided more precise 
calendar information. In addition to the nine cases with duplicate initial interviews, there 
were four cases in which we conducted duplicate follow-up interviews, and three cases 
in which we did a follow-up on a comparison-group woman.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We interviewed 707 women, but later dropped two of the women from the 
sample, one because she later told us that she had falsified the initial interview and the 
other because she told us in the initial interview that she had had no intimate partner in 
the past year (her partner had died over a year previously). Thus, the final sample 
included 705 women, 497 who inter\-viewed as AW and 208 who interviewed as NAW. 
Four women did not complete the initial interview, usually because they ran out of time. 
Two of the four were in the AW group, and neither got to the point in the interview 
where we asked for follow-up information. Therefore, we were not able to find either 
woman for a follow-up. In addition, three women with complete initial interviews did not 
consent to a follow-up, and one consented but gave no follow-up information. Thus, we 
could not follow six of the 705 women, because they did not consent or gave no 
information (Exhibit 31).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Three AW interviews were classified as \'93unreliable\'94 based on the judgement of 
the interviewer. One was terminated by the interviewer, because the woman seemed to 
be unable to comprehend the ques\-tions. Another woman completed the interview, but 
appeared to the interviewer to be \'93completely unstable mentally\'94 and gave unreliable 
and inconsistent answers to many questions (for example, saying that one of her 
children was 200 years old). The third woman had recently suffered a mental 
breakdown, and the interviewer suspected that she was not being abused but was 
abusing herself. We included these three cases in the sample, because mental illness 
was, after all, one of the risk factors we were looking at, but coded some questions as 
unreliable. However, one of these women gave us no contact information for a follow-up, and we were not able to find the other two women.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Interviewer Selection} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It turned out to be a great advantage that the CWHRS was not an academic 
research project, and did not recruit interviewers from among graduate students at a 
university. Instead, the collaborators distributed job notices through public health, 
domes\-tic violence advocacy, and other professional networks. Working with the con\-
sulting psychologist, we developed a set of criteria for hiring, and materials for inter\-
viewing and choosing among potential candidates (see Appendix IV) that empha\-sized 
two sets of skills, training and experience. We wanted to find women who not only had 
interviewing skills and understood the nature of research, but who were also empath\-etic 
and able to listen to difficult stories without judging the women who told them. We were 
extremely fortunate in being able to recruit a group of professional women with those 
skills and more. These interviewers became some of the key project collabora\-tors, and 
the success of the project is due in large part to their commitment and expertise.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Interviewer Training} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The interviewer training covered a two-week period and included training on the 
background and intention of each question, appropriate coding for each ques\-tion, how 
to handle queries about the intention of the survey and each ques\-tion, how to rephrase 
questions without changing the meaning or leading the respon\-dent, how to detect and 
handle a situation in which the woman being interviewed was experiencing distress, 
how to make referrals to outside agencies, awareness and sensitivity training on the 
issue of violence against women, and discussion about personal stress management 
tech\-niques. Interviewers also had several days of mock interviews with various 
scenarios to build up their confidence before they began.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The consulting psychologist provided support to the interviewers, took part in 
training sessions, and conducted regular debriefing sessions with the interviewers 
during which they could discuss stress manage\-ment techniques and anything else that 
was troubling them as a result of their work on the study. (See Appendix V for a full 
description of the debriefing program in the CWHRS.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A key part of interviewer training was training on domestic violence issues, con\-
ducted by collaborators. In addition, a section on interviewer safety issues was con\-
ducted by collaborators from the Chicago Police Department, and a section on support 
materials for the clinic/hospital women was included.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Interviewer Support} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
\tab One of the highest priority considerations of the project was respondent safety, 
which is closely linked to the support and training of the project staff, especially the 
interviewers. Based on the experience of the Violence Against Women survey in 
Canada, Holly Johnson strongly advised us to have a Consulting Psychologist as part 
of the project, both to ensure respondent safety and to support the staff as they conduct 
these stressful interviews. The project was extremely fortunate in hiring psychologist  
Dickelle Fonda, who is skilled and know\-ledgeable in two vital realms - issues of 
violence against women, and techniques of stress management.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Consulting Psychologist\'92s job can be divided into three parts: 1) general 
project counseling, including project support and emergency counseling as needed 
during the interviewing phase; 2) interviewer selection and training; and 3) holding bi-weekly debriefing sessions with interviewers and other project staff. Beginning in 
February, 1997, the psychologist held group sessions with staff to train them in team 
building and stress management techniques, and advised the project about selection 
criteria for interviewers. In addition, the interviewers met as a group every other week, 
in a \'93debriefing\'94 support session led by the psychologist. This system served to solve 
problems before they became emergencies, keep the project running smoothly, and 
provide a less stressful working  environment for the staff (thus reducing the chance of 
turnover and increasing productivity and dedication to the project goals). For details of 
the Consulting Psychologist\'92s role in the CWHRS, see Appendix V.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Follow-up Tracking Methods} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the end of the initial interview, we asked each abused woman for her consent 
to \'94talk to you again and see how things are going.\'94 If she consented (all but three of 
the 497 women did), we asked her to provide sev\-er\-al names and contacts where she 
might be reached for the follow-up inter\-views (see Rumptz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1991 and the final 
pages of the initial interview, Appendix II).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though our original goal was to conduct all of the follow-up interviews face-to-face, it often turned out to be impossible (see the follow-up safety section, above). 
Following the advice of Stouthamer-Loeber, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1992:73) and others that it is impor\-
tant to make participation in the study as easy as possible for woman, we decided to 
conduct follow-up interviews by phone when neces\-sary. We estimate that 79% of the 
323 first follow-up interviews and 91% of the 180 second follow-up interviews were 
conducted over the phone.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Follow-up Retention} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Rumptz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1991) and John\-son (1992) found follow-up tracking and inter\-view\-
ing to be ex\-tremely labor-inten\-sive. It is very important, how\-ever, because the }{\plain \i\f1 unknown 
cases}{\plain \f1  of inti\-mate vio\-lence may repre\-sent one of the highest-risk groups for the death of 
either the woman or man intimate partner (Browne, 1986). As Dobash and Dobash 
(1995) point out, loss of subjects over time is a problem with all longitu\-di\-nal studies and 
a particular problem in intimate vio\-lence studies. We cannot assume that attrition is 
random; it would be more reasonable to assume that the women most dif\-ficult to track 
would also be the most threatened (by stalking, for example) and possibly the most in 
danger. However, with proper attention to detail and \'93vigorous tracking methods\'94 
(Stouthamer-Loeber, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1992), the retention rate in longitudinal studies can reach 90 
to 96% (Schoua-Glusberg & Hunt, 1992), and 94% to 95% in Michigan studies of 
battered women following their stay at a shelter (Sullivan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996; Rumptz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 
1991).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The rates achieved in the Michigan studies were based on data from a shelter 
population, and there are funda\-men\-tal differences between tracking a shelter 
population and tracking a community sample of abused women}{\plain \f1  (Gondolf, 1998)}{\plain \f1 . 
Because women leaving a shelter have sought services, and are more likely to be in a 
protective environ\-ment, there is much less risk and greater perceived benefit for them 
to participate in a study. The CWHRS women were sampled as they entered a clinic or 
hospital. For them, as for the partners of batterer program participants interviewed by 
Gondolf, is was reason\-able to fear that participation in the study might expose them to 
risk. Despite this, Gondolf achieved a retention rate of almost 70% with the men over 
15 months, by using very aggressive tracking techniques including the services of a 
professional locator.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Michigan study tracked participants through \'93family, friends or organizational 
contacts\'94 (Sullivan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996:269; Rumptz, 1991). For safety reasons, the CWHRS 
did not visit neighbors or schools, contact places of employment, or call or visit com\-
munity service organizations, and did not hire a profes\-sional locator to do these things. 
CWHRS policy required that we did not go beyond what the woman had told us in her 
initial inter\-view would be safe. That is, we tried to find and contact her \'93safe contact\'94 
person or people, and we tried to contact the woman herself, if she had told us that it 
would be safe to do so and had given us permission to do so.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS retention rate was 66.5%. We completed at least one follow-up 
interview for 323 of the 486 women who gave consent and follow-up information and 
who were not incarcerated or dead (Exhibit 31, above). In addition to the six women 
who either did not give consent to be followed up, or did not give us any informa\-tion for 
finding them, we found that three women were incarcerated when we tried to contact 
them for follow-up. Unfortunately, the study budget did not allow for the resources 
neces\-sary to interview them in prison. Our investigation also found that at least five of 
the 497 women died in the follow-up year, two of them before their first follow-up 
interview and three afterwards. One of the five women died of an HIV-related illness, 
having become infected by her abuser. The Department of Public Health obtained 
death certificates for the other four women. One woman died of an aneurism, which 
was possibly related to a blow to the head. The other three were killed violently, but 
there is no evidence that the abuser was involved. A woman who worked as a prostitute 
was strangled on the street, one was shot on the street, and the third was killed by 
someone who hunted her down to kill her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The study\'92s retention for a complete year, defined as 350 days or more after the 
initial interview, was 261 women, which is 81% of the 323 women who had at least one 
follow-up interview and 54% of the 486 women who consented and were not deceased 
or in prison. An additional 62 women were followed for periods ranging from 90 to 349 
days. In sum, 66.5% of the women were inter\-viewed again at least once, and 53.7% of 
the women were followed for at least a year (350 days or more).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Length of the Follow-up Period} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Even though our target was to re-interview women for the first time between the 
fifth and seventh month, and for the second time between the eleventh and the 
thirteenth month, the follow-up period for some women was very long (Exhibit 32). 
Thirteen women, 4% of those who had at least one follow-up interview, were followed 
for 20 months (600 days) or more. The first follow-up period varied from only three 
months (90 days) to more than two years (90 to 826 days).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Theoretically, the varying follow-up time period does not pose problem for 
analysis, because we gathered complete calendar information on each woman from the 
time of the follow-up interview back to the time of the previous interview, whenever it 
was. Therefore, the mathematics of calculating \'93survival periods\'94 from the initial 
interview to the next incident would not be affected. However, this assumes that the 
completeness of the calendar did not vary by the length of the retrospective period. 
There was some indication, in the calendar for the initial interview, that women were 
more likely to remember incidents that had occurred in the far past if the incident was 
more serious.\tab Only 30% of the 323 first follow-ups had been completed by the 
end of the sixth month after the initial interview (210 days), and 95 first follow-up 
interviews were not completed until after 12 months (365 days). In addition to these 94, 
nine women had their first follow-up interview between 351 and 364 days after the initial 
interview. For these 104 women (32%), no second follow-up interview was necessary.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 However, for nine of the 104, a second follow-up interview was actually conducted.}}}
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We only needed to conduct a second follow-up interview with the remaining 219 
women, but we found that three of the 219 had died since the first follow-up interview. 
We com\-pleted a second interview with 171 of the remaining 216 women (79%), as well 
as nine second follow-up interviews with women who \'93did not need\'94 one, for a total 180 
completed second follow-up interviews.\par

350 days after the initial interview, with the earliest only 266 days (nine months). In 
total, 27 of the 180 second follow-ups were completed less than 350 days after the 
initial interview, and twelve more were completed between 351 and 364 days after the 
initial interview. For 15 of the 27 and two of the twelve, we were able to conduct a third 
follow-up interview at a later date, bringing the total follow-up period to at least a year.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 Five additional third follow-ups were conducted even though they were not necessary. (We 
already had a year of data.)}}}
}{\plain \f1  
For analysis, information from the third follow-up calendar was combined with 
information from the second follow-up calendar.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Two reasons for the long time period before the first follow-up were safety and 
consent con\-straints and the nature of the population. Many of the women in our sample 
moved frequently or had no permanent address. Often, a woman\'92s safe contact friend 
or relative did not know where she was and might see her only infrequently. When the 
woman would drop by for a visit, her relative would tell her that we would like to talk to 
her. Then the woman might call us that day or in a few weeks or months. For example, 
the woman whose follow-up period was the longest, 826 days from the initial interview 
to the first follow-up, had given her mother as her safe contact person, but her mother 
had moved out of the city. After a long search, we were able to contact her mother, who 
gave our letter to her daughter, who called our 800 number.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Even when a woman would contact us, it was sometimes difficult to arrange an 
interview, even over the phone. Often a woman would call the 800 number, but have no 
safe number where an interviewer could call her back. When these women called from 
Cook County Hospital, we would encourage them to go to the HCIP there, a safe place 
where the interview could be conducted. However, a number of women called, spoke to 
us and scheduled an interview, and then we never were able to contact them again. 
The 57 women who had been homeless or living in a group home or institution at the 
initial interview were particularly difficult to find for a follow-up interview. One was 
incarcerated, and 52% of the other 56 women were re-interviewed, compared to 68% of 
the other women (Chi square p = .013). In all of these situations, the follow-up interview 
was likely to occur many months after the initial interview. However, no matter when the 
follow-up was done, the calendar information was collected for the entire time period 
from the date of the initial interview to the date of the follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We interviewed 17 women (5% of the 323) earlier than the fifth month after the 
initial interview (149 days or less). We decided to interview a woman early when we had 
reason to believe that we would not be able to find her again. For example, the earliest 
interview was done at 90 days. This was a homeless woman who had been inter\-viewed 
at the walk-in clinic and happened to see her interviewer at the Trauma Unit three 
months later. The inter\-viewer\'92s decision to do an early follow-up was good, because we 
were never able to contact the woman again. Of the 17 who completed an early first 
follow-up, seven were never found for a second follow-up.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ulw\f1 Was there Retention Bias in the Follow-up?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Did the 163 women who were not found and interviewed in at least one follow-up 
interview differ significantly from the 323 women who were found? Women in the two 
groups did not differ in any of the basic sample categories - their racial/ethnic group, the 
site of the initial interview, whether the abusive relationship was heterosexual or not, or 
in whether she had been pregnant at the initial interview. There were somewhat more 
initial interviews conducted in Spanish (17.6%) among the 323 successful follow-ups, 
com\-pared to the 163 women who were not found for a follow-up (11.0%), but this 
difference did not reach statistical significance (Chi square p = .057). Similarly, retention 
was higher for Latina/Hispanic women (71%) compared to others (64% for African/American/Black women, and 61% for white or other women), but this difference was not 
statistically significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The two groups were also similar to each other in other characteristics. The 
mean score on HARASS was 5.63 for the re-interviewed cases and 5.48 for the other 
cases. }{\plain \f1 The mean score on the Power and Control scale was 3.44 for the re-interviewed 
cases and 3.51 for the other }{\plain \f1 cases. The mean score on the Social Support Network 
scale was 8.68 for the re-interviewed cases and 8.82 for the other cases. None of these 
differences were statistically significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The mean age of women followed-up was 30.71, and the mean age of the 
women not found was 30.61. There may have been a slight difference in the woman\'92s 
employment status, with 32% of the 323 women followed-up having a full or part time 
job, compared to 24% of the 163 other women, but this difference was not significant 
(Chi square p = .091). House\-hold income was almost the same for the two groups, with 
52% of the inter\-viewed women having a household income less than $10,000 per year, 
compared to 45% of the other women (Chi square p = .237). There was no significant 
difference (Chi square p = .288) in the educational levels of the two groups, with 47% of 
the interviewed women having less than a high school degree, compared to 52% of the 
other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a significant difference, however, in our ability to re-interview women 
who had been homeless or living in an institution or group home at the initial interview. 
One of these 57 women was incarcerated and could not be re-interviewed, and 29 of 
the remaining 56 women (52%) completed a follow-up interview, compared to 68% of 
the 430 other women (Chi square p = .013). In addition, though only 31 women had 
lived in Chicago for less than three years, they had a lower retention rate (48%) 
compared to other women (67%). The retention rate for women who said that they had 
no personal income that they themselves controlled was 56%, compared to 67% for 
other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The recency of the last incident before the initial interview was not related to 
whether or not the woman would do a follow-up interview. The average number of days 
before the interview when the last had occurred was 97.6 for the 322 women who 
completed a follow-up interview, and 83.6 days for the 171 women who did not, but the 
difference was not statistically significant (t test p = .147). (These 171 women include 
women who did not consent, who died, or who were not re-interviewed for any reason.) 
Though the mean number of incidents in the past year was higher for women with a 
follow-up interview (10.73) compared to women without a follow-up inter\-view (8.86), 
again, the difference was not statistically significant (t test p =.336).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was very little difference in the follow-up retention rates of women who 
had exper\-ienced more or less severe incidents in the past year. Combining the three 
most severe categories (beating up, choking, weapon threat, severe injury, or weapon 
use), 61% of the 238 women who had experienced at least one of these in the past 
year were followed-up, compared to 69% of the 255 women who had experienced less 
severe violence, but the difference was not statistically significant (Chi square p = .074). 
The retention rates were very similar for women who had experienced different kinds of 
incidents (Exhibit 33). The lowest retention rate was for the 113 women who had experi\-
enced being beaten up, choked, burned, or serious injury in the past year, 47 of whom 
were not followed-up. One of the 47 was incarcerated, one had died before the first 
follow-up, and one refused consent.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 HOMICIDE STUDY METHODS}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the many methodological obstacles to comparing lethal and non-\-lethal 
cases is that it is impossible to interview people who are dead. Proxy interviews are an 
attempt to overcome this obstacle. The CWHRS study design called for identi\-fying and 
inter\-viewing one to three indivi\-duals who were familiar with the events, circum\-stances 
and interventions that occurred in the year prior to the victim's death. Each of these 
\'93proxy respondents\'94 com\-pleted, as far as possible, the same question\-naire as the 
women sampled in the clinic/hospital settings.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The homicide sample in the CWHRS included all Chicago homicide victims 
known to the police who were killed in 1995 or 1996 by an intimate partner and in which 
at least one partner was a woman aged 18 or older.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \f1 Sadly, there were some intimate partner homicides of women under age 18. These were not 
included in the study, because they would not have been comparable to the clinic/hospital 
sample.}}}
}{\plain \f1  We included cases where a man 
was the victim, as well as cases where a woman was killed. Intimate relationships 
included spouse or ex-spouse, commonlaw or ex-commonlaw, boy\-friend or girl\-friend, 
ex-boy\-friend or ex-girlfriend, and woman same-sex partner or former same-sex partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Homicide Sample} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Homicide incidents were obtained from the Chicago Homicide Dataset (CHD). 
Collected with the close cooper\-ation of the Chicago Police Department since 1968 and 
con\-taining detailed informa\-tion on every homicide recorded by the police (more than 
22,000 homi\-cides), the CHD is the largest, most detailed dataset on violence available 
in the United States (Block & Block, 1993; Block & Christakos, 1995).{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \super\fs20 }{\plain The Chicago Homicide Dataset project began in 1968 with the col\-lec\-tion of 1965 data and 
continues today with the advice and close cooperation of the Crime Analysis Unit of the Chicago 
Police Department. The Authority has supported and maintained the data since 1979. The Joyce 
Foun\-da\-tion currently supports collecting 1991-1994 data and archiving prior years. The National 
Archive of Criminal Justice Data, ICPSR, has 1965-90 data on its violence CD-ROM. See Block 
and Block (1993) for details and bibliography.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Every intimate 
homicide that occurred in Chicago in 1995 or 1996 and involved a woman over age 17 
was included, regardless of whether further investigation determined the homicide to be 
justified. We decided not to include one case in which the victim died in 1995 or 1996, 
after having been in a coma for a decade, because the violent lethal incident had not 
occurred in a sample year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The lethal sample contained 87 cases, including 57 woman victim-man offender 
cases, 28 woman offender-man victim cases, and two cases in which both victim and 
offender were women. However, CWHRS investigation added two cases and deleted 
two cases to the homicides in the Chicago Homicide Dataset that seemed to meet the 
above criteria. A review of all homicides that occurred in Chicago in 1995 and 1996 
determined that two additional cases fit the intimate partner criterion, one woman victim 
case and one woman offender case. Police had coded the victim and offender in each 
of the two cases as "friends," but the narrative stated that the couple had been dating or 
involved in a sexual relationship. In addition, interviews determined that two of the 
cases did not involve intimate partners after all. These two cases were dropped from 
the study.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the first dropped case, we interviewed the woman offender, who told us that 
the man she killed had never been her intimate partner, just an acquaintance. In the 
second dropped case, family members told us that the woman offender had not been 
the girl\-friend of the man victim, but was the girlfriend of the victim\'92s brother, who also 
lived in the house. Although determinations of relationship between homicide victims 
and offenders by police are generally very accurate for intimate partner cases, the 
police files used in this study reflect initial police investigation information that may not 
have been complete at the time it was recorded.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Data Collection and Field Strategies} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original design recognized some potential problems in finding and contacting 
proxies and obtaining inter\-views. The Kellermann research team identi\-fied a proxy 
respon\-d\-ent in 405 of 420 homicides (96.4%). In the 15 cases not identified, there was 
no knowledgeable person, or the only person was the suspect. Of those identi\-fied, 
93%, 98% and 99% were inter\-viewed in each coun\-ty (Kellermann, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1993: 1086). 
Rose (1981:27), however, was able to con\-tact only 74% to 58% of homi\-cide vic\-tims' 
next-of-kin and inter\-view only 58% to 24% of those contacted in three cities. In a later 
study, Rose was able to inter\-view 43% of the victims' next-of-kin.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain \super\fs20 }{\plain Source: conversation with Harold Rose, 12-7-94.}}}
}{\plain \f1  An important differ\-
ence between the Kellermann and Rose proxy studies was that the former inter\-viewed 
proxies within three weeks following the incident, while the lag in the latter was as much 
as three years. Rose cautions that the lag made a difference in response rates. 
However, a shorter lag has other disadvantages. An interview while a case is still being 
ad\-judica\-ted might in\-ter\-fere with the prosecu\-tion or de\-fense. In addition, someone 
involved in the court case might be subject to bias.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The Kellermann proxies were not limited to next-of-kin as in the Rose studies, 
but involved numerous attempts to con\-tact a hier\-archy of know\-ledge\-able people.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain Communication with Joyce Banton, who was in charge of fielding the Kellermann team 
study, and who kindly lent her advise and sug\-gestions to the CWHRS.}}}
}{\plain \f1  
Rose also found that matching the proxy race with the interviewer race seemed to 
matter. Finally, while the Kellermann study's ques\-tion\-naire was short and non-invasive, 
Rose's interview schedule included 178 detailed questions, many of them open-ended, 
about "life history."\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Sources of Potential Proxy Information} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS was privileged to have a diverse and active advisory board of 
collaborating people who opened avenues to sources of case informa\-tion not routinely 
available to social research projects.  For example, the study had access to every homi\-
cide case that occurred during the study period through the Chicago Homi\-cide Dataset 
project. In addition, the Chief Medical Examiner, an advisory board member, made his 
office's files available to staff, although they are not generally open to the public. While 
court files are public informa\-tion, the Clerk's Office was extremely cooperative in pulling 
the 59 court case files in our sample and providing office space for our staff. Even the 
Chicago Public Library assisted us in looking for newspaper articles from the 
newspapers without on\_line access.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS was also fortunate to have a good working relationship with the 
Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). We were allowed to interview the 10 women 
who had been sentenced to prison for killing their intimate partner. Seven inter\-views 
were conducted at two prison sites. One inmate, with the help of her counselor, 
completed and mailed back the questionnaire, and two interviews were conducted in 
the homes of women who had just been released onto Mandatory Supervised Release.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Three months after data collection began, we sought the assistance of the Illinois 
State Police, through a liaison staff member working at the Authority on another project. 
Names of potential proxies were submitted to ISP's Resource Support Center. The 
liaison staff member forwarded relevant information to the interviewers. Any confidential 
information was deleted before dissemination.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another potential source of knowledgeable proxies was newspaper articles of the 
incident. These were relatively uncommon, and tended to occur for the more complex 
and  \'93newsworthy\'94 cases, such as homicides with more than one victim.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Analysis of Official Data Sources to Provide Proxy Leads} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Initial narrative information in the police and medical examiner files information 
provided many directions for locating proxies. In the initial stages of proxy data 
collection, it was important to ascertain the outcome of the case, in order to take 
advantage of any information available from the courts and the Department of 
Corrections, in those cases where someone was arrested (Exhibit 34). We had the 
fewest potential sources of official data for the 28 cases that did not reach the court 
system.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Field Work Strategies} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab While the study had access to many types of information on each homicide case, 
much of it was already out of date by the time the proxy study was fielded. Using homi\-
cides that had occurred three to four years previously had advantages and disad\-van\-
tages for field work. Because most cases had been adjudicated, potential proxy 
respondents who might have been involved in the court case were free to talk to us 
without jeopardizing the case in any way. On the other hand, almost all of the 
addresses and phone numbers recorded at the time of the homicide had become 
outdated. This meant that the primary task of the proxy portion of the study was the 
fieldwork required to ascertain the identity and current whereabouts of potential proxies. \par
}{\plain \f1           Three primary strategies were used to develop proxy contacts:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \_ phone calls, using numbers listed in the case file, current telephone books, 
Haynes Criss\_cross directory at the Harold Washington Public Library, the Internet 
directories;\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \_ letters introducing the study and inviting participation to potential proxies; and\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \_ field visits to the homicide site, to neighbors of the couple, to funeral homes for 
information on who arranged for the funeral, to other potential proxies' home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Phone calls alone were sufficient to identify and contact a knowledgeable proxy 
respondent in 19 of the 74 completed cases (26%). Using the Haynes Criss-cross 
directory for neighbors\'92 and other tenants\'92 phone numbers yielded positive results in 
several cases. It also aided in locating maintenance personnel. A combination of phone 
calls and field visits were necessary in 55 cases (74%). Proxy information in the case 
files was exhausted without leads in four of the 87 cases (5%). In three cases, the 
family refused to participate. In the remaining cases, there was either no survivor who 
knew about the relationship or we ran out of time.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the end of the study, a professional locator was hired at $100 per verified 
proxy contact, for the last cases where all other leads had been exhausted. These most 
difficult cases proved to be the women originally charged by the State\'92s Attorney\'92s 
Office. This locator was successful in locating potential proxy respondents in seven 
cases, although some of those people declined to participate in the study.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Setting Priorities Among Potential Proxy Respondents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Our goal was to find people who might be knowledgeable and credible proxy 
respondents about the relationship between the victim and the offender in the year prior 
to the incident that led to the death. Commonly, a person mentioned in official sources 
was disqualified as a proxy respon\-dent, because they were strangers to the victim and 
the offender, though they might have been an eyewitness to the homicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Not every potential proxy respondent knows about the same aspects of the 
relationship, or has the same perspective. We learned that adult children and sisters of 
the woman are more knowledgeable informants than parents. The legal guardian of 
dependent children is almost always knowledgeable about the relationship, as are 
some co-workers and supervisors, especially if the victim had worked for one company 
for an appreciable time. Other good proxy respondents are neighbors and close friends.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In some cases we identified an ideal proxy respondent who would have been 
able to tell us about certain of the more sensitive questions, such as the women\'92s 
support network, but the person refused to cooperate or said that they could not face 
the inter\-view just yet. In cases that had been opened at the beginning of proxy data 
collection, the interviewers were able to work with the potential proxy respondent over a 
period of months. Often, after a considerable period of contemplation, the proxy 
respondent felt strong enough and trusted the interviewer enough to feel able to 
complete the interview. In other cases, this never happened, sometimes because there 
was not enough time left before the end of data collection for this trust to develop. In 
those situations, we were forced to interview someone else who might not be as close 
to the victim.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborators had some concern about the danger of interviewing a proxy 
who had been a confident of only one of the intimate partners, and who might have 
limited or biased information about the relationship. We discovered that it was best to 
use informa\-tion from many sources, not all of whom provided a complete inter\-view. For 
example, a buddy of the man offender might be the best source of informa\-tion about his 
friend\'92s drinking or drug abuse, but not much more. His mother might provide the most 
accurate information on his education, employment, and mental and physical health. 
However, the next door neighbor might be the best person to complete an entire 
interview about the couple\'92s relationship in the year before the death. The goal was to 
use all of the available information to answer as many questions as possible.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Frequently, we found a potential proxy respondent who knew a great deal about 
the victim or the partner but little or nothing about the relationship. We considered this 
partial success. One proxy respondent with all the needed information may not be 
possible in every case; however two or three proxy respondents, each with a different 
set of facts, can result in a complete interview with no missing data. For example, 
some\-times we located a potential proxy respondent who had socialized with the victim 
and knew the victim\'92s alcohol and illicit drug use well but knew nothing of the 
relationship with the offender. We recorded the needed information, knowing additional 
proxies would be needed to gather the rest of the data. In general, we actively searched 
for additional proxy respondents who would be able to \'93fill in the blanks\'94 in the 
questionnaire.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to conducting formal interviews, the interviewers also recorded 
separately any facts that they might discover in the process of their field work search for 
proxy respondents. For example, the building manager of the apartment building where 
the final incident occurred might know who was living in the household, or whether the 
victim and offender were living together. In some cases, an interviewer might begin a 
conversation with someone during field work, and in the middle of the conversation 
realize that this person is knowledgeable and credible and would make a good proxy 
respondent. In such situations, the interviewer would obtain informed consent and 
begin the formal interview, if possible.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the beginning of the project, some potential proxy respondents were lost when 
interviewers scheduled an appointment at some later date. The interviewers discovered 
that it was a good idea to be prepared to give an interview whenever the opportunity 
presented itself. Our philosophy was that it was better to interview extra people, even 
though some of the information might be redundant, than to risk losing a potentially 
good proxy respondent. Interviewers kept detailed records and field notes about the 
degree of knowledge and credibility of each person in respect to each question, in 
addition to the repeated questions contained in the questionnaire itself (Appendix II).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, in most cases, the proxy study interviewers did not start out with a list of 
potential proxy respondents. Instead, they needed to conduct field work in order to 
develop this list. The interviewers recorded, on project field work forms (see Appendix 
VI), their field work contacts and investigations, the list of potential proxy respondents 
and their decisions about the best people to interview.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Support of the Proxy Respondents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the biggest obstacles to obtaining interviews once a proxy was located 
was the amount of grief still being suffered by the families involved, even several years 
after the homicide. The interviewers encountered much initial resistance to talking about 
the incident, for fear of the pain it might cause. In several instances, siblings would 
actively shield the mother from contact with the interviewer. CWHRS staff developed a 
list of grief support resources by geographic area as a resource for families still needing 
such support. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  One of the great successes of the project was that the interview process itself 
ended up being very therapeutic for many of the proxy respondents. This, in turn, 
encouraged the inter\-viewers to be persistent in their proxy respondent contact efforts, 
even in the face of initial rejection or repeated interview rescheduling.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Organizing and Interviewing Skills} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The most successful interviewers developed an organized system for keeping 
track of attempts being made to locate proxy respondents. At any given time, inter\-
viewers were working on ten to twenty cases. Therefore, meticulous note-taking and 
record-keeping was indis\-pen\-sable for successful case completion, including notes of 
follow-up dates, who was spoken to, what was said, usefulness of phone numbers, 
when to call (AM or PM), call back request dates, and a log of all phone, field and mail 
attempts. In addition, it was very helpful to organize fieldwork geographically, so that 
several sites to could visited or revisited during one fieldwork trip. Planning fieldwork 
around the time children come home from school was a successful strategy for several 
reasons: the neighborhoods are safer at that time, other adults are more likely to be 
home, and the children themselves were often good sources of information about 
adults\'92 whereabouts.  \par
\tab In conducting the actual interviews, several skills were essential for devel\-oping 
rapport with the proxy respondent and eliciting information on a painful topic. It was 
crucial that the interviewer be relaxed and empathetic, and avoid appearing too 
\'93official.\'94 Memorizing the questionnaire allowed the interviewers to begin interviewing a 
potential proxy respondent whenever the opportunity arose (on the doorstep, in several 
cases).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Dealing with potential respondents who refused to participate was also a major 
element of the interview process. Most potential respondents needed time to decide 
whether to participate or not, given the amount of grief about the incident most still felt. 
It was helpful to contact them again after some time had lapsed, appealing for 
cooperation from several different angles. Successfully dealing with unresponsive proxy 
respondents was a continuing topic in the weekly debriefing sessions (Appendix V), and 
was instrumental in increasing the case completion rate.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Proxy Respondent Interviewers} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Hiring and Training} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We decided to hire and train interviewers who were experienced in working out 
in the field, such as public health nurses, to do both the identification and the locating of 
potential proxies and the subsequent interviews. This approach turned out to be very 
successful. The four interviewers who completed the study were comfortable in the 
field, became adept at following all kinds of leads in finding people, and had the 
all\_important quality of being able to present the goals of the study to the proxies in 
such a way as to elicit almost 100% cooperation once proxies were located.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A second key decision concerning training the proxy interviewers was the 
assump\-tion that some attrition in interviewer staff would occur over the course of the 
study. Therefore, eight women were trained. Another key decision was to require the 
completion of the entire training session as a condition for being hired.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 20-hour training session for the proxy interviewers (see Appendix VI), was 
similar to the training that had been conducted for the clinic interviewers. It focused on 
all aspects of the proxy interview process: conducting fieldwork, conducting the actual 
proxy interviews, and documenting all case activity. The Advisory Board was asked to 
lend its expertise, and conducted sessions in awareness of general domestic violence 
issues, cultural sensitivity, safety in the field, and developing fieldwork strategies. Judith 
McFarlane \'93attended\'94 the training via speaker-phone, in order to tell the interviewers 
about the successful Houston experience, and to let them know the field strategies that 
had worked in Houston.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Interviewer Support} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the most important considerations of the proxy portion of the CWHRS 
was interviewer safety in the field. We had some general idea of the geographic 
location of the homicide incidents (see maps, Appendix VIII), but the search for know\-
ledgeable proxy respondents led the interviewers across the Chicago Metropolitan area 
and beyond.\par
\tab Team building among the interviewers was an important step in creating support 
for each other during fieldwork, in addition to contact with Authority project staff. To that 
end, we held weekly three-hour debriefing meetings during the entire seven months of 
proxy data collection (Appendix V). Each debriefing session began with 60 to 90-minutes of practical and administrative team work discussion, such as reviewing each 
case, sharing success\-ful field strategies, brainstorming dead-end cases, and raising 
any other issues related to the proxy interviews. Judith McFarlane, again, generously 
offered her help and support, attending two debriefing sessions via speaker phone.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The second part of these weekly meetings consisted of group team building and 
stress management exercises led by Dickelle Fonda, the counseling psychologist. 
These weekly meetings were instrumental in keeping up interviewer morale, particularly 
when it took several weeks for the first proxy respondents to be located and inter\-
viewed.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Payment Plan} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One issue that was never quite resolved during the course of data collection was 
how the interviewers should be paid. Before the proxy interviewers were hired, three of 
the veteran clinic/hospital interviewers worked out a payment plan with the principal 
investigator that everyone thought was fair. Payment would be "piece rate," a fixed 
amount for each interview completed and a fixed amount for the concomitant fieldwork 
involved in the case. An interviewer could earn $140 or $180 per case, depending on 
the number of interviews, regardless of how much field work was necessary. We 
developed standards (Appendix VI) for what constituted a completed inter\-view (worth 
$40), and what constituted a com\-pleted case (worth $100 for the fieldwork).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For safety reasons, the interviewers could decide to pair up into teams, to 
support each other during fieldwork. Payment then was made to the team for $150 for 
fieldwork and $40 per interview ($75 and $20 per team member). In practice, such 
teamwork was impractical, since the interviewers and the cases assigned were 
geographically dispersed, and much of the fieldwork could be accomplished over the 
phone. In the end, the team payment option was dropped, and each interviewer was 
paid $150 for fieldwork and $40 for each completed interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Homicide Case Completion} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The lethal sample contained 87 homicides, including 57 women victim cases, 28 
women offender cases and two same-sex cases. In eleven of the 87 homicides, we 
have only official record data. We obtained at least one proxy respondent interview or 
an interview with the woman offender on 76 (87%). (Though we actually completed 78 
cases of the original 89, two of these were found to be ineligible, because the victim 
and offender had not been intimate partners.)}{\plain \f1  These 76 cases included 49 of the 57 
women victim cases (86%), 26 of the 28 women offender cases (93%), and one of the 
two same-sex cases (Exhibit 36). We did as many as three interviews per case, for a 
total of 85 interviews of proxy respondents and 15 interviews of the woman offender. In 
ten cases we did an interview with the woman offender plus one or two proxy 
respondents, and in five cases we did only an inter\-view with the woman offender.}{\plain \f1 \par

}{\plain \f1 \tab We attempted to interview all of the women offenders who were still living and 
where the case had been adjudi\-cated. }{\plain \f1 Of the 30, one committed suicide at the scene, 
one died in prison, and one case was still being adjudicated, leaving 27 women to be 
interviewed. We}{\plain \f1  succeeded in interviewing nine of the 11 women who had been sen\-
tenced to prison, the one woman sentenced to probation, two of the four women found 
not guilty, and three of the 12 women in which the ASA rejected prosecution, a total of 
15 interviews of the 27 women (56%). In addition, we completed one or two proxy 
interviews for ten of the 15. For all but three of the other 15 women offender cases, we 
completed the case with one or more proxy interviews but not an interview of the 
offender. This interview rate was somewhat higher than Hattendorf, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1999), who 
attempted to inter\-view all 29 women who \'93admitted to killing abusive partners\'94 in Illinois 
in 1996, but who found that none of the five women who were not incarcerated agreed 
to participate.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We obtained permission from the Illinois Department of Corrections (DOC) to 
interview the eight women offenders who were still in prison when data collection 
began. All of the women consented to be interviewed. Five were interviewed in prison, 
and two had been released by the time the request had traveled through DOC, but 
were found and consented to an interview. We were unable to locate one woman until 
after the prison interviews had been done, because she was incarcer\-ated under 
another last name. She consented, and we mailed a question\-naire to her in prison. She 
completed it and sent it back to us. In total then, we obtained interviews from all of the 
eight women intimate homicide offenders who were or had been in prison.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Cases took an average of two months to complete from the date the case was 
assigned to the date of the interview, not counting the time it took for the interviewer to 
edit her field notes and turn in the case. There was wide variation in this completion 
time, depending on the mobility of the proxy respondents, and whether, once contacted, 
they needed time to decide to parti\-cipate. Forty-one percent of the 76 cases were 
completed in less than a month, but some took as long as seven months. It took an 
average of seven attempted contacts before an interview was actually conducted.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Combining Rules for Cases with Information from Multiple Sources} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It took as many as three interviews, in combination, to compile the information 
necessary for a complete case (see Exhibit 36, above). Our goal was to have reliable 
and credible information for each question in the questionnaire, for each of the 87 
homicide cases. For some cases and for some questions, we had more than one 
source of informa\-tion - interviews with one or two proxy respondents, interview with a 
woman homicide offender, and official record data from several sources. There\-fore, one 
of the first tasks of data analysis was to combine all of this information into a \'93master 
file\'94 for each case. If a question had multiple responses, we had to decide what 
response to code in the master case file.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Anticipating that we might receive contradictory information from two or more 
proxy respondents, we developed a set of rules to use on a question-by-question basis. 
The rules combined degree of credibility with degree of knowledge. For example, 
someone who knew about a specific question because of direct observation would have 
a higher degree of know\-ledge than someone who knew because they had talked to 
someone else who had been there. However, these rules were seldom necessary in 
practice. Responses were much more likely to be complementary than contradictory. In 
most cases, responses dovetailed \_ that is, blanks on one questionnaire were filled by 
information on another.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In some cases, the proxy respondent was not as knowledgeable or credible 
about the fatal incident as the official record data. For example, one victim was killed by 
strangling then mutilated with a knife. The proxy respondent, who found the body, told 
us about the knife wounds but did not know the cause of death. Another proxy 
respondent had never seen the body and apparently was not told how her daughter 
died.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A proxy respondent\'92s credibility and degree of knowledge depends upon the 
specific question. For example, a drinking buddy of the man victim might not know 
about prior violence, but might be a reliable source of information about his drinking 
pattern. Though a proxy respondent\'92s perception of the final event might not be credible 
(several denied that the murder had happened), yet the person could be a 
knowledgeable and credible source of information on the health and mental condition of 
each partner, their children and living arrangements, whether they were estranged, and 
harassment and violence in the previous year. Also, a proxy respondent sometimes 
denied harassment or violence when asked directly, but told the interviewer details of 
harassment or violence when responding to open-ended questions. In coding, we used 
all responses, from the entire interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the present analysis, we have included only the woman\'92s responses, in the 
ten cases where the woman offender was interviewed as well as one or two proxy 
respondents. We did this for two reasons. First, we reasoned that, because she was 
there, she had a high degree of knowledge. Second, her responses are directly 
compara\-ble to the questions asked the women in the clinic sample. (We did not 
interview proxy respondents for the women in the clinic/hospital sample.) The exception 
was for the few questions about any of her violence toward her man partner. These 
questions had not been included on her ques\-tion\-naire, because they were not asked of 
the clinic sample (see Appendix II). We recorded the proxy respondent\'92s answers to 
those questions (using a separate code so they could be excluded from future analysis 
if desired).}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Homicide Cases with no Interview Data} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In eleven of the 87 intimate partner homicides, we were unable to obtain at least 
one interview with a proxy respondent or with the woman offender, although we still 
were able to gather information from various official and public sources for these eleven 
cases. In this section, we outline the reasons for not being able to complete these 
eleven cases, and conduct a comparison with the cases for which we were able to 
obtain at least one interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We decided not to pursue two of the eleven because of safety considerations. In 
one of these cases, the victim was a gang member and there was some concern that 
our interview process would generate retaliation against the family. In the other case, 
the only way to reach a potential proxy respondent involved wandering around a very 
dangerous high-rise building without knowing the specific apartment number or floor.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In one case, we determined through investigation that there was no one who 
could be a knowledgeable and credible proxy respondent for the woman offender, who 
had died in prison. Our investigation could not find any surviving person who knew 
about the relationship, either on the offender\'92s side or the victim\'92s side.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In three cases, interviewers were able to contact one or more potential proxy 
respondent, but the person declined to participate. In one of the three, the potential 
proxy respondent did not want to talk about the incident because it would be too 
traumatic to re-experience. In the other two, the potential proxy respon\-dents did not 
want to be interviewed because they believed that the person charged was not guilty 
and that the relationship had not been violent. If more time had been available, we 
might have been able to obtain an interview in these cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At the end of data collection on May 30, 1999, three cases were still in the 
criminal courts, and in two of these, one case with a woman victim and offender and 
one case with a woman victim and man offender, potential proxy respond\-ents declined 
to talk to interviewers (see Exhibit 35 above).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the remaining three cases, the interviewers were not able to identify or locate 
any potential proxy respondent, even with the help of a profes\-sional locator on one of 
the cases. Being unable to uncover a promising lead within the time constraint was the 
problem in these cases. The interviewer spent a month or less attempting to make 
contacts in two cases, and used only the initial phone numbers and did no field work or 
extra investigation in the other.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The problems faced in these eleven cases were also present in most of the 
completed cases, but were overcome. Frequently, none of the potential phone numbers 
or addresses in official records produced a lead. The phone number had been dis\-con\-
nected, no one ever answered, or the person who answered said that no one lived 
there by the name in question and that they didn\'92t know anyone by that name. When 
the interviewers went to the address, it was a vacant lot or building, or the occupant had 
no knowledge of the people in question. Interviewers attempted to obtain leads by 
questioning neighbors living in the immediate area of the potential addresses, but were 
not always able to uncover any positive lead to an interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A comparison of the known characteristics of the eleven cases without at least 
one interview and the 76 cases for which we obtained an interview shows no systematic 
bias. This comparison is based on information obtained from police and other official 
sources, for both groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Victims in nine of the 11 non-interviewed cases (82%) were women, including 
one killed by a same-sex partner, compared to 49 of the 76 (65%) interviewed cases. 
This happened because we interviewed woman offenders but not the man offenders.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The mean ages of victims and offenders did not differ significantly in the two 
groups. The victims\'92 mean age was 34.6 in the non-interviewed and 34.4 in the inter\-
viewed cases, and the offenders\'92 mean age was 35.1 and 34.7, respectively. Seven of 
the 11 victims (64%) in the non-inter\-viewed cases were African/American/Black, three 
white (27%), and one Latina/Hispanic, about the same as the interviewed 76 cases, 
which were 80% African/American/Black, 9% white, and 10% Latina/Hispanic. Thus, 
our interview rates seems to have been somewhat lower for cases with white victims. 
This may reflect our lack of non-Latina white interviewers, as Harold Rose had warned.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Relationship was not different in the two groups. Of the ten heterosexual cases 
without an interview, in three the victim-offender relation\-ship was husband/wife or com\-
mon\-law, and in seven the relationship was boyfriend/girlfriend, including two former 
relationships. Of the 75 heterosexual with an interview, 27 (35%) were husband/wife or 
commonlaw, 46 (61%) were boyfriend/girlfriend, and two (3%) were ex-boyfriend/girlfriend.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was no association between the type of police clearance of the case and 
whether or not we were able to obtain at least one interview with a proxy respondent or 
woman offender (Exhibit 37). We completed an interview in 88% of the 59 cases in 
which the offender was arrested, 80% of the 10 cases in which the offender committed 
suicide, both of the two cases of other offender death, and 86% of the cases in which 
the ASA rejected charges.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab  All together, we interviewed 85 proxy respondents in the 76 cases, with 50 of 
them (56%) the only person interviewed in the case. Of the 85 proxy respondents, 69 
(81%) were a confidant of the victim, and in 42 of the 50 cases with only one proxy 
respondent (84%), that person was a confident of the victim. This happened because 
the avail\-able contact information contained more data for people on the victim\'92s side. 
Medical Examiner\'92s Office files contained information on the victim's relatives (the 
person who claimed the body), and the most useful court document, the Victim Impact 
Statement, also focused on the victim's family.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the one same-sex case with an interview, the single proxy respondent was a 
confident of the victim. Exhibit 39 details the relationship of the proxy respondent to the 
intimate partners in each of the other 70 cases in which a proxy respondent was inter\-
viewed. (This excludes five cases in which only the woman offender was inter\-viewed 
and the one same-sex case.)\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab There were 61 proxy respondents interviewed in the 49 woman-victim cases, of 
whom 51 (84%) were confidants of the victim, compared to 17 (77%) of the 22 proxy 
respondents in the 26 woman-offender cases. Of the 37 women-victim cases with only 
one proxy respondent, that person was a confidant of the victim in 32 (86%), and of the 
11 women offender cases with only one proxy respondent, that person was a confidant 
of the man victim in nine (82%). In two of these nine cases, we could not find the 
woman nor her confidant; we located the woman in one case, but she denied that she 
was the person we were looking for; and in the other case, we did not locate the woman 
and the family members refused. In the one completed same-sex case, the proxy 
respondent was the sister of the victim and was very knowledge\-able about the 
relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The most common proxy respon\-dent in both women-victim and women-offender 
cases was the victim's sister (22%), followed by the victim\'92s mother (21%), all other 
relatives of the victim (22%), the victim\'92s neighbors (7%), other friends or confidants 
(10%), the offender\'92s mother (7%), the offender\'92s sister (5%), and other offender confi\-
dants (5%). Women proxy respondents were more common than men.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although we had expected that relatives, friends or other confidants of the victim 
would tend to tell us positive things about the victim and negative things about the 
offender, and that confi\-dants of the offender would do the opposite, that was not always 
the case. For example, a relative living in the same house (often the mother, but in one 
case a brother) often had considerable information about the relationship and about 
both intimate partners.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Quality of Proxy Respondent Information} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Given that obtaining intimate partner homicide data via proxy methodology has 
been rarely used, it was important to assess the reliability and validity of the information 
collected. A full-blown investigation into this issue was beyond the scope of this report.  
However, it was possible to assess the reliability of the proxy respondents\'92 responses to 
two types of information: readily observable variables (such as age, race, type of union, 
alcohol or drug use, facts about the lethal incident, etc.) that could be verified indepen\-
dently by official sources, such as police or medical examiner records); and less 
observ\-able char\-acteristics and behaviors, such as any PTSD, fear of her partner, and 
so on.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Proxy respondents were in agreement with independent sources for almost all 
demographic characteristics. The most notable differences were whether the couple 
involved in the lethal incident were actually intimate partners (in two cases, it was deter\-
mined that they were not intimate, although they had been initially identified as such by 
police), and the age of the intimate partners. Also, we found considerable agreement 
across proxy respondents and between the reports from a proxy respondent and the 
woman herself.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Missing and Incomplete Data in Proxy Respondent Information} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab How knowledgeable are proxy respondents? In 15 of the 76 interviewed cases, 
we interviewed the woman offender, either by herself or in addition to a proxy 
respondent. Therefore, a comparison of missing data in the responses of the proxy 
respon\-dents }{\plain \f1 in the other 61 interviewed cases}{\plain \f1  to the responses of the women 
themselves in these 15 interviews provides some indication of the degree to which a 
proxy respondent was likely to know about the questions in the interview. Since all of 
the 15 interviews with the woman offender were in heterosexual cases, for consistent 
comparison, this analysis compares them to the 60 completed heterosexual cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Demographics} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . All of the interviewed women offenders were able to provide the 
man partner\'92s age. In all of the 60 other completed cases, proxy respondents were able 
to pro\-vide the ages of both partners. All of the interviewed women offenders and all but 
one of the proxy respondents provided the marital status at the time of death, and all of 
them answered the question about length of relationship. All of the women responded 
about her educational level, but in eight cases (13%), proxy respondents did not know 
about the woman\'92s education. All of the women responded about her employment, but 
this information was missing in two of the 60 other completed cases. All the women told 
us their birthplace, but in three of the other completed cases, the proxy respondent did 
not know.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Children} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . All of the women answered the question about children, and one of the 
60 proxy respondents did not know. Of the 42 cases where the proxy respondent knew 
there were children, four were missing information about where the children had been 
living before the death.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Estrangement or Separation} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was no missing data to the question asking 
whether the victim and partner were living together in the month prior to the fatal 
incident. There was no missing data on whether the victim and offender had been 
current or former intimate partners at the time of death.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Firearms} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Two of the women offenders (13%) did not know whether or not the 
victim had a firearm in his home. Only 10% of the proxy respondents in the other 60 
cases did not know whether or not the victim had a firearm in his or her home. Of the 15 
woman-offender cases, proxy respondents in one case did not know whether the man 
victim had a gun in his home, and of the 49 woman-victim cases, four did not know 
whether the woman victim had a gun in her home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Woman\'92s Physical Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Like the 15 women offenders who were interviewed, 
all of the 60 proxy respondents in the other heterosexual completed cases were able to 
answer a question about the woman\'92s general health, and her health at the time of the 
death compared to a year before the death. No proxy respondent case was missing 
information about whether she had been limited due to a physical condition, what that 
condition was, and how long she had it. However, in three of the 60 cases, the proxy 
respondents did not know how often she had seen a medical practitioner in the year 
before the death.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Woman\'92s Substance Use} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . All of the 15 interviewed woman offenders answered 
the questions about their substance use. In only one of the 60 completed heterosexual 
cases, the proxy respondent did not know whether the woman had ever had an alcohol 
problem, in five cases they did not know if she had ever had a drug problem. One of the 
24 who answered \'93yes\'94 did not know if alcohol was a problem for her in the month 
before the death, and all of the 24 proxy respondents who answered \'93yes\'94 knew if 
drugs had been a problem in the month before.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Woman\'92s Mental Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Only one proxy respondent case was missing informa\-
tion about whether the woman had been limited due to an emotional condition, what 
that condition was, and \'93how long have you had it?\'94 Each of the interviewed women 
offenders answered each of the 17 PTSD questions. Of the 60 other completed hetero\-
sexual cases, the proxy respondents were unable to answer three or more of the 17 
questions in ten cases (17%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Support Network} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 15 interviewed women offenders responded to all of the 
questions about their support network. In two of the 60 completed heterosexual cases, 
the proxy respondent could not provide information about any of these 12 questions, 
and in one case the proxy respondent provided information about only four of the 12. In 
two cases, the proxy respondent did not know how long the woman had been living in 
Chicago, and in two cases the proxy respondent did not know whether or not the 
woman had any money that she controlled.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Power, Control and Stalking} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 15 interviewed women offenders responded to 
all five of the Power and Control questions, and to all 20 of the HARASS questions. In 
the other 60 completed heterosexual cases, the proxy respondents were unable to 
answer at least two of the Power and Control questions in eight cases (13%). In six 
cases (10%), the proxy respondents were unable to answer at least ten of the HARASS 
questions, and in another seven cases they were unable to answer from five to nine of 
the questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Violence in the Past Year} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The proxy respondent questionnaires did not include 
the same type of calendar history as the clinic/hospital sample questionnaires. It did not 
seem likely that proxy respondents would know, or could accurately recall in detail, 
each violent incident that may have occurred in the year prior to the death. Instead, 
violence and the severity of violence in the past year was assessed by the eleven 
questions in the J section of the questionnaire (see Appendix II), as well as other 
summary questions that also appeared in the clinic/hospital questionnaire. However, 
some proxy respondents were not able to provide even this simpler information (Exhibit 
40).\par

development is discussed above, in the Questionnaire section.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Management of Name, Name2 and Name3 Information} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Considering the number of abusive partners identified and the various locations 
in which Name could be found in the initial questionnaire, there was considerable 
oppor\-tun\-ity for typos or coding errors. Therefore, we manually reviewed the question\-
naires to ensure that the recorded characteristics (age, race, length of relationship, etc.) 
were linked to the true Name. Of the 497 women interviewed as AW, 79% identified 
only one intimate partner, the person she \'93feels closest to.\'94 However, 107 women 
identified more than one person in the interview. These cases were reviewed manually 
to verify the identity of Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The person identified as Name in the initial interview was to be tracked to the 
first and second follow-up interviews. In the first follow-up, the interviewer requested 
informa\-tion \'93about the person we talked about at our last interview.\'94 However, }{\plain \f1 some 
women did not remember the code name that she had given to Name in the initial 
interview, and}{\plain \f1  discussed a person other than Name. For example, she might discuss a 
non-abusive intimate partner, or an abusive intimate partner who was identified in the 
initial interview but was not chosen as Name, or someone she had not previously 
identified. Where possible, the interviewer had consulted the initial question\-naire before 
the follow-up interview, knew who Name was, and was able to remind the woman. 
However, that was not always possible. CWHRS women were often difficult to locate for 
a follow-up interview. Because the interviewer had no way of knowing which of the 497 
women would reply to a telephone call or letter or when, the inter\-viewer might not have 
the case file available when the woman replied. As a result, there were several 
interviews in which the person discussed as \'93Name\'94 in the follow-up was not Name. If 
contact information was available, the interviewer was asked to request the follow-up 
information on Name from the woman. Where further contact was not possible, the 
Name follow-up information was coded \'93missing.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the first follow-up interview, if the person identified was not Name but was 
actually another abuser, this second intimate partner was coded as Name2. Name2 
was also identified at Question J13 in the follow-up. The follow-up interviews were also 
manually reviewed to verify follow-up information on true Name and Name2. The same 
procedure was followed in the second follow-up to verify and tie the appropriate 
individual characteristics to Name and Name2.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Management of Incident-Level Data} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Before the data were analyzed and the research questions answered, some 
manipulation of the data was necessary. Three questionnaires were used to collect 
data from the clinic/hospital sample, one for the initial interview and two more for the 
subsequent follow-up interviews. The initial interview was designed to collect 
retrospective information. Questions were asked about abuse that had happened in the 
past year, twelve months before the date of the interview. The follow-up interviews were 
designed to collect prospective information from only the 497 women who were abused 
at the initial interview. Questions in the first follow-up asked about abuse since the initial 
interview and questions in the second follow-up asked about abuse since the first 
follow-up. Data from each of the three questionnaires were first entered in Microsoft 
Access, checked for typographical errors and then transferred to SPSS for further 
cleaning and coding. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the initial and two follow-up interviews, a calendar history was used to capture 
a detailed history of abuse incidents and the events surrounding the incidents. The 
calendar used during the initial interview covers a retrospective year in the life of the 
abused woman (one year before the interview date). The calendar from the first follow-up covered the period from the initial interview to the date of the first follow-up and the 
calendar from the second follow-up covered the period from the first follow-up to the 
second follow-up. Thus, the CWHRS interviews collected data at two levels, individual 
level and incident level. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Individual versus Incident Level Data} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Each of the three questionnaires used to 
collect information from the clinic/hospital sample contained 13 sections and a calendar. 
The section that asked about the woman\'92s pattern of incidents over the time period of 
the interview corresponds with the incident calendar, but the information from this 
section of the questionnaire was individual-level. The information collected was 
summary data, such as \'93did a miscarriage ever occur as the result of an incident in the 
past year?\'94 or \'93was anyone ever present during an incident?\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The calendar, on the other hand, was incident-level. The calendar recorded 
detailed information about each incident that an abused woman experi\-enced during the 
time period covered by the interview. If, for example, the woman said she had a 
miscarriage or someone else was present during the incident, the interviewer circled 
yes to the two questions on the questionnaire, but also indicated on the calendar, at the 
date of the incident, exactly who was present during that specific incident and whether 
the woman had a miscarriage as a result of the incident. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The individual-level data files have one record of information for each woman. 
The incident-level data files have one record of information for each incident that each 
woman experienced. Because of the different levels of data, the total number of records 
is not the same for the individual-level data and the incident-level data. If a woman told 
us about more than one violent incident, the incident-level dataset contains multiple 
records for her. Exhibit 41 illustrates the difference between the number of records in 
the indivi\-dual-level data files and the number of records in the incident-level data files.\par
\tab The incident data are in a separate data file with one record for each incident. 
The 493 responding women reported 4,974 incidents of abuse in the initial interview, an 
average 10.1 per woman. Of the 323 women interviewed in the first follow-up, 161 
reported 1,172 (7.3 on average), over a follow-up time span ranging from three to 23 
months. Of the 177 women inter\-viewed in the second follow-up, 64 reported 347 
incidents in total (5.4 on average), over a time span ranging from two weeks to 15 
months.\par

}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Aggregating Incident-Level Data for Each Woman} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Detailed incident data are 
necessary in order to understand the history of violence for women who have very 
different life experiences, and to compare them to women who died or who killed their 
partner. However, before a comparison can be made, the data captured at the incident 
level must be summarized for each woman. This is accomplished by aggregating the 
incident-level data to the individual level. Such aggregate information allows us to 
create key variables for analysis of risk factors, such as the number of severe incidents 
that occurred in the past year, the most serious incident that occurred, whether any 
incident in the past year involved drug use, or how long before the interview the most 
recent incident had taken place. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Aggregating incident-level data compiles all incident information in the calendar 
history into an individual-level variable for each woman. For example, a woman could 
provide information about three incidents, where a child was present during all three 
and an adult was present during one of the three incidents. To determine at the 
individual level, who was present during any incident in the past year, two variables 
would be created. One variable would capture the number of incidents in which a child 
was present, which in this case would be 3. The other variable would capture the 
number of incidents in which an adult was present, which in this case would be 1. By 
creating these summary variables, incident-level information is converted to individual-level.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Aggregate data are necessary for some kinds of analysis, but other kinds of 
analysis require the detail of incident-level data. For example, if we want to know 
whether or not the abuser\'92s use of alcohol or drugs is a high-risk factor for serious injury 
or death, it is important to distinguish between the abuser\'92s general pattern of 
substance use and whether or not the abuser is drunk or high in the particular incident. 
These are related, of course. However, an aggregate analysis of the number of drug-related incidents over the past year will not tell you whether drug use in a particu\-lar 
incident is related to injury severity in that incident. To reap the benefits of both 
individual-level analysis and incident-level analysis, the CWHRS was organized so that 
it would support either.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Variable Follow-up Period} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS design called for collecting data 
covering at least a year after the initial interview. The original goal was to re-interview 
women for the first follow-up between the fifth and seventh month after the initial 
interview and for the second follow-up between the fifth and seventh month after the 
first follow-up. This would have placed the second follow-up around one year after the 
initial interview. However, the actual time periods varied from three to twenty months for 
the period between the initial interview and the first follow-up and two weeks to twelve 
months for the period from the first to the second follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A few women were not found for their first follow-up interview until after twelve or 
more months. These women did not need a second follow-up, since the first follow-up 
captured a year after the initial interview. In addition, some women were contacted for a 
first follow-up interview almost a year after the initial interview. If the total number of 
days between the initial and first follow-up interviews was less than 365, we tried to 
contact women for a second follow-up. Therefore, some of the women were interviewed 
for a second follow-up only a few weeks after their first follow-up. Regard\-less of when 
the first or second follow-up was completed, however, the calendar history covered all 
of the months between the initial interview and the last follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because of the calendar, we can calculate a length of time, in days, between the 
initial and follow-up interviews for each respondent. Also, because the dates of each 
incident are recorded, we can determine the exact time period from incident to incident 
and from each interview to each incident. Therefore, having varying follow-up periods 
does not pose a problem for analysis.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Prospective Account of Abuse and Events} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Although it has not yet been done as 
of this report, it will be necessary to combine the calendar events and incidents from the 
first and second follow-up interviews into a single data spanning spans the calendar 
from the date of the initial interview to the date of the final interview. This will involve 
cleaning the data to make sure that there are no overlapping incidents, incidents 
recorded in both the first and the second follow-up interview.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Incident Date} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the calendar history, most of the time, the women remembered the exact date 
when an incidents occurred, or could estimate the date. However, there were some 
cases where the abuse was frequent and routine. In these cases, the woman provided 
a span of time during which the same thing had happened regularly. For example, a 
woman may say that an abuser beat her up every weekend during June and July. We 
created variables to handle data entry in such situations, covering the span of time from 
the first occurrence to the last occurrence. These span variables include the beginning 
date (year, month, day) and the ending date (year, month and day) of each span of 
incidents.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Statistical Analysis} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because of the size and complexity of the CWHRS data, the primary goal of the 
analysis covered in this report was to thoroughly document the methods, data 
definitions, and basic data inter-relationships, so that this initial report would serve as a 
foundation for more detailed explanatory analyses. In addition, the focus of this report 
was trained on the original, primary question of the research - the development of sets 
of risk factors for serious injury or death in intimate violence situations.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, the analysis in the report traveled systematically and exhaustively 
through each variable and each major question. Almost all of the data were presented 
as frequencies or simple cross-tabulations, with descriptive statistics, usually Chi 
square and Gamma. When scale development and reliability were issues, Alpha was 
used, and factor analysis was occasionally used as part of the scale development 
process. Relation\-ships between variables were usually presented as two- or three-variable tables with summary descriptive statistics, but when appropriate to the type of 
data, we used correlations or partial correlations. We also used multiple regression, but 
only as an exploratory tool to summarize the relative importance of all of the risk 
factors, protective factors and interventions at each point of the \'93abuse process.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 CLINIC AND HOSPITAL FINDINGS}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The remainder of this report presents the findings of the Chicago Women\'92s 
Health Risk Study, first the findings from the 705 clinic/hospital women, then the 
findings from the 87 homicide cases, in comparison to the clinic/hospital women. 
Finally, a \'93Conclusions\'94 section attempts to assemble the most important points from 
the entire report, and to discuss their implications.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Lengthy as this report is, it only begins to examine the depth of information 
available in the CWHRS data. Our primary goal in this report was to document the 
methods of the study, and to system\-atic\-ally review the data, point by point, so that the 
report could become a solid foundation for more thorough examination of causal 
relationships in data. The report is intended to be a \'93desk reference\'94 for the research 
and practice communities, and for CWHRS collaborators, as they conduct further 
analyses and write more detailed but focused reports for a variety of professional and 
lay audiences.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The \'93Clinic and Hospital Findings\'94 begin with three sections that are largely 
descriptive. Since clinic/hospital women sampled in the CWHRS were not randomly 
selected from the population as a whole, but rather, were selected from sites purposely  
chosen because they served areas with high intimate partner homicide rates, many 
characteristics of the 705 women clinic/hospital women were different from characteris\-
tics of the \'93average\'94 Chicago women. The purpose of the \'93Sample Characteristics\'94 
section is to describe the CWHRS women, so that the reader will be able to understand 
them better, and have a context for the events in their lives.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The following section, \'93Differences between Women who Interviewed AW versus 
NAW,\'94 looks systematically at each of the risk factors and protective factors. Although 
the sample design (see \'93Clinic and Hospital Sample\'94 section, above), dictated that 
about 70% of the CWHRS women would interview as AW, women in some kinds of 
situations were more likely than others to interview as AW. This analysis had two goals. 
First, we wanted to determine whether a woman with a given characteristic was 
significantly more or less likely to have interviewed as AW. Second, we wanted to give 
practitioners who work with women in settings similar to that of the CWHRS a picture of 
the women they encounter on a daily basis.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The section on \'93Characteristics of Violence in the Past Year\'94 is still mainly 
descrip\-tive, but instead of describing the woman and the relationship, it describes the 
close to 5,000 incidents of intimate partner violence that happened to these women in 
the year before the initial interview. Each of the 87 homicides was also an individual 
incident in the women\'92s lives. This section lays a foundation for the comparison of the 
87 lethal incidents to the 4,974 non-lethal incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It is only with the next section, however, \'93Correlates of Severity and Number of 
Incidents in the Past Year,\'94 that we begin to address the issues that were the central 
focus of the CWHRS \'96 of women being violently abused by an intimate partner, what 
situations indicate a high risk of severe injury or death? With this section, we begin to 
look specifically at women who experienced physical violence or threat. Again, going 
systematically through each risk and protective factor, we ask what was different 
between situations in which the abused woman had experienced at least one severe 
incident and situations in which she had not, and what was different when women had 
experienced many incidents in the past year versus one or two. Bringing all of the risk 
and protective factors together in an exploratory multi-variate analysis, we ask what 
combinations of factors seem to be more important for distinguishing those abused  
women who had experienced the most severe violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The next section introduces the analysis of help-seeking activities and interven\-
tions. It describes the ways in which CWHRS women tried to deal with the violent 
incidents, and examines the relationship between the severity of the violence in the 
past year and types of help-seeking activities and interventions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The final section of Clinic and Hospital Findings, \'93Risk Factors for Future Abuse,\'94 
comes even closer to the central focus of the CWHRS by introducing analysis of the 
follow-up data. This section looks at whether the violence continued in the follow-up 
period, and if the violence continued, how severe the incidents were. A key necessity 
for severe injury or death is the continuation of intimate partner violence against the 
woman. If there is never another violent incident, there can never be an incident severe 
enough to cause death. This section also goes systematically through each risk and 
protective factor, looking at their relationship to continuing severe violence, and 
concludes with an exploratory multi-variate analysis. However, it adds a new group of 
risk factors - the characteristics of the incidents that happened to the woman in the past 
year. \par
\par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Sample Characteristics} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The original design of the CWHRS called for a non-lethal sample that included 
women from all socioeconomic levels, with enough women of color so that it would be 
possible to determine whether high-risk factors for a lethal or life-threatening outcome 
were different for abused women who were African/American/Black, Latina/Hispanic or 
white or other. Unfortunately, though we}{\plain \f1  were successful in establishing partnerships 
with health centers serving large propor\-tions of disadvan\-taged women,}{\plain \f1  we were unable 
to retain research partners from health centers that served mostly upper and middle 
class women. These centers were recruited in the same ways and times as those who 
partici\-pa\-ted (see Carey, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996, for a discussion of recruitment methods), and it is 
not clear to us why they decided not to take part. Because there are very few middle 
class and very few \'93white or other\'94 women in the sample (see Exhibit 14, above), the 
CWHRS cannot claim that its results are applic\-able to those groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, we seem to have met our sample design goals of including 
pregnant women and \'93hidden\'94 women who may be high risk but their risk is unknown to 
helping agencies. Of the 702 women who answered, 10% were pregnant at the initial 
interview, 18% had been pregnant in the past year, and nine women (1.3%) said they 
did not know whether they were pregnant or not. The proportions of women who were 
pregnant or had been pregnant did not differ significantly among the AW versus the 
NAW women. Nor did the proportions of women who were African/American/Black, 
Latina/Hispanic or white or other.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 705 women interviewed, the CWHRS design called for 70% to interview 
as AW and 30% to interview as NAW. Therefore, we tried to interview every woman 
who screened AW, but only about 20% of the women who screened as NAW (see 
Exhibit 7, above). Because of this, the sample characteristics of the 705 women may be 
affected by any tendency of women who interviewed as AW to differ from women who 
interviewed as NAW. The numbers and percents shown in the following tables are the 
original data, not weighted to reflect the AW-versus-NAW proportions of women. In 
most cases, because the AW and NAW women did not differ significantly, this makes 
no difference. Situations in which the two groups did differ are pointed out in the 
narrative below, and discussed in more detail in the next section, \'93Differences Between 
Women Who Interviewed AW Versus NAW.\'94\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Place of Birth and Language} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another indicator of the diversity of the population of women sampled in the 
CWHRS is the proportion who were born outside the United States (Exhibit 42). Of the 
701 women who responded to this question, 113 (16%) were born in other countries, 
including 85 women (12%) born in Mexico. Smaller numbers were born in Nigeria, 
India, Pakistan, Germany, Austria, Poland, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, 
Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Jordan and 
Taiwan. Most of the United States are represented in the CWHRS sample, with 32 
women (5%) born in Mississippi, 11 in Arkansas, nine in New York, nine in Missouri, 
seven in Tennessee, and the rest scattered around the country.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 700 women who responded, 90% had been living in Chicago for many 
years or all her life, 3% for three or four years, and 6% for two years or less. However, 
only 74% of the 159 Latina/Hispanic women had lived in Chicago for many years, while 
11% had lived there for three or four years, and 14% for less than that. African/American/Black women were the most likely to have lived in Chicago for many years 
(98%), and the least likely to have lived there for three or four years (0.2%) or less 
(1.9%). White or other women were between the two other groups, with 86% having 
lived in Chicago for many years, 5% for three or four years and 9% for less time. This 
did not differ significantly between the AW group and the comparison group.}{\plain \f1 \par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 705 interviews, 111 (16%) were conducted in Spanish. None of the 467 
interviews with an African/American/Black woman, 109 (69%) of the 159 interviews with 
a Latina/Hispanic woman, and two (3%) of the 66 interviews with a white or other 
woman were conducted in Spanish.\par
\tab For the Latina/Hispanic women, there was a significant difference (Chi square = 
.011; Gamma = .417, p = .014) in the percent who interviewed in Spanish between the 
women who interviewed as AW versus NAW (75% and 56%, respectively). Of the 109 
women who interviewed in Spanish, 79 (72%) interviewed as AW, compared to 26 of 
the 50 (52%) of the women who interviewed in English. It is pos\-si\-ble that the 
Latina/Hispanic women who were interviewed in Spanish felt more comforta\-ble about 
revealing abuse, even though each woman chose the language of the interview. Also, 
the nuances of the language in the Spanish version may have communicated more 
clearly about these sensitive issues. However, as we have seen above (\'93Was There an 
Interview Selection Bias by Age or Language?\'94), there was no bias in whether we 
interviewed a woman or not, based on the language she used in the screener.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Employment, Education and Income} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, the socioeconomic status of the women interviewed in the CWHRS 
reflected the populations of the relatively disadvantaged neighborhoods served by the 
participating clinics and hospital. Of the 701 women who told us their primary occupa\-
tion at the initial interview, 48% said they were unemployed, 10% were students, 10% 
were homemakers, and 33% had a full-time or part-time job. (This question allowed the 
woman to provide more than one answer. The \'93primary\'94 occupation given here is the 
one she mentioned first.) Many of the women who said they were employed were also 
students. In all, 13% were students at the time of the initial interview, with 54% of those 
attending school full time. For African/American/Black women only, there was a 
significant difference (Chi square = .006; Gamma = .283, p = .006) in the percent 
unemployed between the women who interviewed as AW (59%) and the comparison 
women (44%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Four of the 703 women responding when asked the highest grade or year of 
school completed had never had any formal education at all (two AW and two NAW 
women); 7% had never attended high school; 37% had some high school educa\-tion but 
had not graduated; 25% had graduated from high school or had a GED certificate; 26% 
had some college, community college or a vocational school education; and less than 
4% (25 women) had graduated from a four-year college. For African/American/Black 
women only, there was a significant difference (Chi square = .039; Gamma = .103, p = 
.036) in the percent with a high school degree between the women who interviewed as 
AW (54%) and the comparison women (65%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 695 women who responded when asked if they had in the last year any 
\'93money or income that you control,\'94 19% said \'93no.\'94 There was no significant difference 
between the AW women and the comparison women. Of those who answered \'93yes,\'94 
41% said that their yearly personal income in the past year was less than $5,000, 21% 
from $5,000 to $9,999, 12% from $20,000 to 29,999 and 6% received $30,000 or more.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 588 women who responded to the question about their total household 
income in the past year, 31% said that it was less than $5000, 20% from $5,000 to 
$9,999, 23% from $10,000 to $19,999, 10% from $20,000 to $29,999, 6% from $30,000 
to $39,999 and 10% said that it was over $40,000. There were no significant 
differences between the AW and the comparison groups. This represents a much lower 
household income for CWHRS women, compared to households in Chicago as a 
whole. This is true for each racial/ethnic group, and especially for the white or other 
women in the CWHRS (\-Exhibit 43).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab While a few women in the CWHRS had a household income of $40,000 or more 
(11% of responding African/American/Black women, 3% of Latina/Hispanic women and 
13% of white or other women), the numbers were much smaller than would be 
expected if the CWHRS had been a random sample of Chicago households. 
Conversely, the proportion of women with a very low household income was much 
higher in the CWHRS than in Chicago as a whole.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS sample, the woman\'92s age was related to her racial/ethnic group 
(Exhibit 44). Latina/Hispanic women were the youngest on average, African/American/Black women a little older, and white or other women older still. For the 692 women 
who responded to our request to describe their race or ethnic group and who did not 
say that they were inter-racial, 70% of the white or other women were over age 30, and 
42% were over age 40, compared to 51% and 17% of the African/American/Black 
women, and only  38% and 9% of the Latina/Hispanic women. For 
African/American/Black women only, there was a significant difference (Chi square = 
.003; Gamma = .182, p = .017) in the age distribution between the AW and the 
comparison groups, with the AW women tending to be younger (mean age = 30.2) than 
the NAW women (mean age = 33.3).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The women sampled in the CWHRS were, on average, younger than women in 
the Chicago population (Exhibit 45). Though the age categories are not exactly the 
same, it is clear that many more of the CWHRS women were aged 18 to 20, and many 
fewer were aged 49 or over. This is not surprising, since one of the sampling goals was 
to include pregnant women.}{\plain \f1 \par

}{\plain \f1 \tab When women were asked to tell us their marital status, 148 (21%) of the 700 
who responded said that they were married, another 32 (5%) were in a commonlaw 
marriage, two said they were engaged, 14 (2%) were widowed, 55 (8%) were 
separated, 62 }{\plain \f1 (9%)}{\plain \f1  were divorced, and 387 (55%) were single. By comparison, women 
in the general Chicago population in 1990, who did not have \'93commonlaw marriage\'94 as 
a choice, were more likely to say they were married (36%), less likely to be single 
(36%), widowed (13%) or separated (5%), and about equally likely to be divorced 
(10%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The racial/ethnic groups differed signifi\-cantly (Chi square < .0001) in how she 
described her marital status to us. Latina/Hispanic women were much more likely to say 
they were married (43%), compared to African/American/Black women (12%) or white 
or other women (37%). Only one African/American/Black woman and one white woman 
described her marital status as commonlaw marriage, compared to 30 (19%) Latina/Hispanic women. For white or other women only, there was a significant difference (Chi 
square = .013; Gamma = .582, p = .014) in the percent who said they were married, 
26% of the 43 who interviewed as AW and 57% of the 23 who interviewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In contrast, the 467 African/American/Black women were much more likely to say 
they were single (68%) than the 159 Latina/Hispanic women (29%) or the 66 white or 
other women (25%), and the white or other women were much more likely to be 
divorced (23%) than the African/American/Black women (9%) or the Latina/Hispanic 
women (3%). For Latina/Hispanic women, the 105 who interviewed as AW were 
significantly (Chi square = .047; Gamma = .341, p = .055) less likely to say they were 
single (24%) than the 54 women who interviewed as NAW (39%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We asked women to describe their relationship with Name (Exhibit 19, above). 
(Remember that, for women who interviewed as NAW, \'93Name\'94 refers to the closest 
intimate partner, and for women who interviewed as AW, \'93Name\'94 refers to the chosen 
abusive partner.) Most of the CWHRS women described their relationship with Name as 
boyfriend (48%) or husband (22%). However, like the woman\'92s description of her 
marital status, the description of her relationship tended to differ for the three racial/ethnic groups (Exhibit 46). African/American/Black women were more likely than others 
to describe their relationship as boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, while husband or 
commonlaw husband was more likely for Latina/Hispanic women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  For all of the CWHRS women except for the Latina/Hispanic women, there was 
a significant difference between those who inter\-viewed as AW and those who 
interviewed as NAW in whether their relationship with Name or their current partner was 
\'93current husband.\'94 Of the 340 responding African/American/Black women who 
interviewed as AW, 30 (9%) were in a current husband relationship, compared to 21 
(17%) of the 126 women who interviewed as NAW (Chi square p = .016; Gamma = 
.348, p = .033). Of the 42 responding white or other women who interviewed as AW, 11 
(26%) were in a current husband relationship, compared to 14 (61%) of the 23 women 
who interviewed as NAW (Chi square p = .006; Gamma = .629, p = .006).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who interviewed as AW were asked to list the partner or partners who 
"hurt or beat you in the past year." Usually, this person was the person she had said 
she "currently spend[s] the most time with and feel[s] closest to," but not always. At the 
initial interview, women mentioned up to three abusive partners in the past year. For 
395 of the 497 women (79%), she mentioned one abusive partner and that person was 
the closest intimate partner. For 69 women (14%), she mentioned one person and that 
person was not the closest intimate partner. Thirty-three women mentioned two or three 
abusing intimate partners. For five of these 33 women, the closest intimate partner was 
not one of the two or three abusive partners. Of the remaining 28 women with two or 
three abusing intimate partners, one of which was the closest intimate partner, 18 
chose the closest intimate partner as Name and ten chose another of the abusers as 
Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, for the great majority (83%) of the 497 women, Name was the same 
person as her closest intimate partner. In all but two of the 84 cases in which Name was 
some\-one else, the relationship was former (a current same-sex partner and a 
boyfriend), compared to 31% of the other 413 cases. In most of the 84, Name was an 
ex- or former boyfriend (68%), compared to 24% of the others. In 15% Name was an 
ex- or former husband or commonlaw husband, compared to 5% of the others. In one 
of the 84 cases, Name was a former same-sex partner, in five cases Name was her 
child\'92s father, and in the remaining six cases Name was a former or ex-friend, fianc\'e9 or 
sex partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab About a third (32%) of the 697 responding CWHRS women had lived with Name 
for the entire year prior to the interview, another third (31%) had lived together at some 
time during the year but were now living apart, and over a fourth (28%) had never lived 
together. The Latina/Hispanic women who interviewed AW versus NAW were the same 
in this regard. For the African/American/Black women, there was a significant difference 
(Chi square p = .013; Gamma = .293, p = .021) in the percent who had lived together 
the entire year between the AW women (18%) and the NAW women (28%). This was 
also true for the white or other women, with 33% of the 42 who interviewed as AW and 
77% of the 22 who interviewed as NAW having lived with Name for the entire year (Chi 
square p = .001; Gamma = .744, p < .0001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For all CWHRS women, there was a significant difference (Chi square p < .0001; 
Gamma .332, p < .001) in the percent of AW women (23%) versus NAW women (38%) 
who had never lived with Name at any time. There was also a difference by racial/ethnic 
group in the percent who had never lived with Name (see Exhibit 18, above). The 
majority (60%) of the 192 women who had never lived together with Name had been in 
the relationship for at least a year, and a considerable proportion (26%) for three or 
more years.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Same-sex Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS interviewed 19 women who said that they were in a same-sex 
relation\-ship, and all but one interviewed as AW. This high percentage is probably due 
to women not mentioning a same-sex relation\-ship to the interviewer, until they had 
already divulged information about partner abuse. Several of the women who were 
being abused by a same-sex partner also had a man intimate partner. When asked for 
information about their intimate partner, they told us about the man. It was not until we 
got to the abuse sections of the interview that the woman told the interviewer about her 
abusive same-sex partner. Thus, some of the 705 women may have been in a non-abusive same-sex relationship, but did not tell the interviewer about it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, some women who had told us about an abusive man partner at the 
initial interview told us later, after developing more rapport with the interviewer, that the 
man abusive partner was actually a woman. There could be additional cases like this in 
the sample, where the woman never felt she could reveal this information to us.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 19 relationships, 13 were current and six ex- or former. Six (32%) had 
been in the relationship for one year or less, and nine (47%) for over one to two years, 
but two women had been in the relationship with Name for more than five years. The six 
ex- or former relationships were considerably shorter than the 13 current relationships.

interview, four for the entire year and five more recently.\par

mean age was the same (31) for both groups. Nine (47%) had graduated from high 
school, compared to 55% of the other women. All of them had lived in Chicago for 
many years or their whole life, compared to 91% of the other women. None was born 
outside the United States, compared to 17% of the others, and only one (5%) of the 
interviews was in Spanish, compared to 16% of the interviews with other women. Only 
one woman was a home\-maker (5%), compared to 10% of the others, but about the 
same percents had a full or part-time job (37% and 33%, respectively). The household 
income was under $10,000 for ten of the 19 (53%), compared to 51% of the others, and 
14 (74%) had a personal income less than $10,000, compared to 82% of the others. 
Almost the same percent had children (73% and 77%, respectively), and three of the 19

age as Name (closest intimate partner), or within four years of Name\'92s age, regardless 
of her racial/ethnic group (Exhibit 47). Though the age difference was usually small, in a 
few cases it was substantial. One woman interviewed as AW was 17 years older than 
Name, and one woman interviewed as NAW was 20 years older than her closest 
intimate partner, while one Name was 42 years older than the woman. There was no

}{\plain \f1 \tab How many children did the CWHRS women have? This seems to be a simple 
and straightforward question, but it is not. Do we mean only young children, or do we 
want to know how many children all together? Are we interested only in children who 
live in the same household as the woman? What about children who are living in the 
same house\-hold, but who are not the woman\'92s children? Like marital status and 
estrangement, it is important to specify exactly what is being measured. For example, 
counting only the 643 women who had a home (they were not home\-less or living in a 
group home) and who responded, 415 (65%) lived in a household with at least one 
child under 18 (Exhibit 49), but it should not be assumed that all of these children were

}{\plain \f1 \tab For 75 of the 415 women (18%), none of the children living with her was her own 
child. Many of the youngest women were living with their parents, and these children 
were her brothers, sisters, nephews or nieces. Older women were more likely to have 
grandchildren living with them. In addition, 94 women (23%) lived in a household that 
included both their own child or children and at least one other child under age 18. 
These women were typically in the \'93middle\'94 age categories, and they and their children 
were living with a sister or another relative who also had children. Only 246 women 
(59%) were living in a household with children in which the only children under age 18 
were their own.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to children aged 17 and younger, 47 (7%) of the 643 women who 
were not homeless or in a group home had children older than age 17 who were living 
with them. There were 62 older children in all. Most adult children were aged 18 to 20 
(33 children) or 21 to 25 (20 children), but seven were aged 26 or older. The oldest 
child living with his or her mother was age 37.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Other women, especially those who were homeless or living in a group home, 
had children aged 17 or younger who were not living with them. Of the 60 women who 
were not living in their home, 38 (63%) had children living away, as did 111 (17%) of the 
642 other women. At least five women, however, managed to keep their family 
together, even when she was on the street or living at a treatment center or shelter.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, the average number of children, seen in Exhibit 49, above, may be an 
over-simplistic measure. Having children may be a risk factor or may provide a 
protective effect for the woman, but to measure these effects we have to take into 
account where the children are living, the age of the children, and whether the father 
was Name or some\-one else. These things are related to the woman\'92s age (Exhibit 50).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The proportion of women who have had no children was, of course, higher for 
younger women. About half (53%) of the 115 women aged 18 to 20 did not have any 
children, but only 4.5% of the 22 women aged 51 or older. However, the children that 
older women had were likely to be older themselves. These patterns may seem obvious 
in retrospect, but a \'93simple\'94 analysis that ignored them might render the conclusions 
invalid.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The definition of \'93stepchild\'94 can be equally complex. In the CWHRS, Name is 
defined as a stepparent to one of the woman\'92s children when 1) the woman had 
children who are living in her household, and 2) at least one of these children was 
fathered by a partner who is not Name. It does not matter, to this definition, whether or 
not Name is living in the household, or whether or not Name is married to the woman. 
The analysis in this report includes the 17 cases where Name was the father of at least 
one child and the stepfather to at least one other child in the \'93stepparent\'94 category.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 638 responding women who were not homeless or living in a group home, 
185 (29%) had at least one child living at home who was a stepchild to Name, but this 
differed for women in different racial/ethnic groups (Exhibit 51). Of the 414 African/American/Black women who responded, 138 (33%) had at least one child who was a 
stepchild to Name, as did 36 of the 155 (23%) Latina/Hispanic women. It was much less 
common for Name to be a stepparent to the child of a white or other women, largely 
because they were much less likely to be the mother of a child living in her home. For 
over half (52%) of the Latina/Hispanic women, Name was the father of all her children 
at home, twice the percent of the rest of the CWHRS women. Latina/Hispanic women 
were also much less likely to have no children living with them, compared to the other 
women.\par

National Women\'92s Study, 4.6% of United States adult women had enough symptoms in 
the previous six months to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and 5.1% met PTSD 
criteria in the twelve-month follow-up. Other national studies show a prevalence of 
about 7% in the general population (Kilpatrick, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 , 1998:161). However, 63% of the 
CWHRS women who interviewed as AW and to 28% of those interviewed as NAW met 
the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. The difference between the AW and NAW women is 
statistically significant (Chi square p <.0001; Gamma= .620). It is unclear why CWHRS 
women had such a high prevalence of PTSD. It may be that the women sampled by the 
CWHRS were not only more disadvantaged than the \'93average\'94 Chicago woman, but 
also were more likely to have had one or more traumatic experience, even those 
women who interviewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The prevalence of a PTSD diagnosis for those CWHRS women who had inter\-
viewed as NAW was comparable to the prevalence for women in the nationwide study 
who had experienced at least three violent assaults in their life. The National Women\'92s 
Study PTSD prevalence ranged from 28.5% for women who had suffered three 
assaults in their lifetime, 10.7% for women with two prior assaults, 8.9% for women with 
one prior assault, and 3.6% for women with no prior assault.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Firearms in the Home} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 639 women who responded and who were not homeless or living in a 
group home or treatment center, 51 (8%) reported that they had at least one firearm in 
their home, and two women said that they didn\'92t know. In addition, two of the homeless 
women said that Name kept a handgun. Of the 51 who said \'93yes,\'94 43 reported at least 
one handgun (one women did not know and seven reported a long gun). Twenty-two of 
the 43 women reported that a handgun was kept loaded at home. Only ten of the 51 
women who had a gun in the household had acquired the gun herself. In 15 cases, it 
was the woman\'92s partner, and in 21 cases it was a parent or grandparent.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was no significant relationship between the women who interviewed as 
AW and the comparison group in whether there was a firearm in the woman\'92s home. 
How\-ever, it was very infrequent for the Latina/Hispanic women. Only three of the 105 
women who interviewed as AW said that there was a firearm in her home, and none of 
the 54 who interviewed as NAW. Overall, less than 2% of the interviewed 
Latina/Hispanic women said that there was a firearm of any kind in her home, 
compared to 10% of the African/American/Black women and 12% of the white or other 
women. Therefore, the overall proportion of CWHRS women who have a firearm in the 
home is less than it would have been without the Latina/Hispanic women in the sample.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because some of the unique characteristics of the CWHRS sample have been 
found in other studies to be related to a low level of firearm ownership, it might be 
expected that the CWHRS women would be unlikely to have a firearm in the home. For 
example, national surveys have found that low-income urban women with children in 
the home are less likely to have a handgun in the household (Powell, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998; 
Smith, 1999). Therefore, Exhibit 53 tries to take some of these factors into account, 
comparing the percent who have a handgun in the home in specific groups of CWHRS 
women to the percent in the NORC survey of the same specific groups. In every case, 
the CWHRS women still were less likely to have a handgun in the household. However, 
because of the nature of the CWHRS sample, this is only suggestive, not definitive.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 639 CWHRS women who responded and were living in a home, 43 said 
there was a handgun in the home. This handgun ownership rate (6.7%) is much lower 
than found in other studies of inner-city firearm ownership, such as the estimate of 
19.9% in the National Opinion Research Center\'92s General Social Survey (Smith, 1999), 
or state-level data (Trent, 1998), even when we compared women with similar 
characteristics. However, direct comparison is impossi\-ble, because the women in the 
CWHRS were not a popula\-tion-based sample of all Chicago women, but chosen from 
areas and sites with a high rate of intimate partner homicide. On average, the CWHRS 
women are, as we have just seen, much more likely to be disadvantaged than the 
average Chicago woman. They tend to have fewer resources, such as income and 
education.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, the level of handgun ownership among the Chicago women seeking health 
services in the sampled neighborhoods seems to be low, compared to other women 
across the country. We do not know if this represents a decline in handgun ownership 
in the neighborhoods, or whether the level of handgun ownership in these 
neighborhoods has always been low. Although some have argued that women are 
increasingly obtaining a handgun for protection against an abusive intimate partner (see 
Silver & Kates, 1979), analysis of national trends (Sheley, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1994) did not find any 
recent increase.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The characteristics of the 705 women interviewed in the CWHRS reflect the 
design and sample goals of the study. The CWHRS design called for about 70% of the 
women to interview as AW, and about 30% as NAW. Therefore, although we tried to 
interview every woman who screened AW, we did not try to inter\-view every woman who 
screened NAW. In describing the sample characteristics of the 705 interviewed women, 
this section has detailed those situations where a tendency of women who interviewed 
as AW to differ from women who interviewed as NAW may have made a significant 
difference in the characteristics of the total clinic/hospital sample.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The primary goal for the non-lethal sample was that it would be compar\-able to 
the lethal sample -- women who become either the victim or the offender in an intimate 
partner homicide. We attempted to meet this goal by inter\-viewing women in health 
settings in Chicago neighborhoods where the intimate partner homicide rates were the 
highest. Since women who become a homicide victim or offender may not have 
contacted a shelter or other helping agency, we tried to make sure that the CWHRS 
sample would not exclude \'93hidden\'94 women who might be at high risk but who were not 
known to be at risk by any helping agency. In addition, we tried to include enough 
women of color and enough expectant mothers so that we would be able to look at any 
risk patterns that might be unique to one of these groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As a result of these sampling goals, the 705 women interviewed in the CWHRS 
were in some respects different from the \'93average\'94 Chicago woman. About two-thirds of 
the CWHRS women were African/American/Black. Almost a fourth were Latina/Hispanic, and 16% of the 705 inter\-views and 69% of the interviews of Latina/Hispanic 
women were in Spanish (75% of the interviews of Latina/Hispanic women who 
interviewed as AW). There were fewer women aged 50 or older and more women aged 
18 to 24 in the CWHRS sample, compared to Chicago women as a whole. Almost 30% 
of the CWHRS women were pregnant or had been pregnant in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS women tended to be more disadvantaged than the average 
Chicago woman, with less education and a lower household income. They were much 
more likely to have a PTSD diagnosis than women nationwide. Levels of depression 
were high, with almost 30% of all CWHRS women, and almost half of the 
Latina/Hispanic women, saying that they had been bothered by depression in the past 
month. A quarter of CWHRS African/American/Black women, and a third of the 
Latina/Hispanic women and the white or other women, had threatened or attempted 
suicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab CWHRS women were less likely to have a handgun in their home, compared to 
similar groups of women in the general U.S. population. While almost all of the African/American/Black women in the CWHRS sample had been born in Illinois or the Midwest, 
and most had lived in Chicago their whole life or for many years, only 23% of Latina/Hispanic women and 44% of white or other women had been born in Illinois. About 15% 
of the Latina/Hispanic women and 9% of the white or other women had lived in Chicago 
less than three years.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The woman\'92s relationship to her partner tended to differ for different racial/ethnic 
groups. Over half of the Latina/Hispanic women were married to or in a commonlaw 
relation\-ship with their partner, while the partner for about three-quarters of the African/American/Black women was a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Most of the partners were 
close in age to the woman. About a fifth of the women had been together with their 
partner for 12 months or less, and over a third had been together more than five years. 
Over a quarter (27%) of the CWHRS women had never lived with her partner; the 
majority of these women had been in the relationship for at least a year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a child living in the household of 85% of CWHRS women, but only 
53% had her own child or children living in the same house\-hold. For the rest, the 
children in the household were her siblings, or the children of friends or relatives. For a 
quarter of all CWHRS women (26%), but over half (52%) of Latina/Hispanic women, 
Name was the father of all of her children living at home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Differences Between Women Who Interviewed AW Versus NAW} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 705 women in the CWHRS sample, 497 interviewed as AW and 208 
interviewed as NAW. The overall percent who interviewed AW was a result of the 
sample design, not the proportion of women in the population who were being 
physically abused by an intimate partner. As discussed above, the sample design 
called for interviewing every women who screened AW, but only about 30% of the 
women who screened as NAW. We succeeded in doing this, and, as a result produced 
a sample that includes about 70% women who interviewed as AW and 30% women 
who interviewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab To be categor\-ized as NAW after the interview, the woman must have been age 
18 or older, have a current intimate partner, and answered \'93no\'94 to every question in 
Section J (Appendix II). Some women who interviewed as NAW had screened as AW. 
See the section on Screening, above, for a full discussion of these women. We did not 
do a calendar history for women interviewed as NAW. Further abuse questions other 
than Section J were not asked of NAW women, because we were concerned about 
seeming to harangue them.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab While the focus of the CWHRS was to compare women at high risk of a lethal 
outcome to other abused women, the NAW comparison sam\-ple con\-nects CWHRS 
results to the many studies that compare abused women to women in general, and 
provides information for clinic or hospital prac\-ti\-tio\-ners to use when designing interven\-
tion strate\-gies for abused women. The following analysis looks at the association 
between a number of risk factors and the likelihood that the percent interviewing as AW 
is higher, or lower, than the design-driven 70% \'93base rate\'94 of the study.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Age and Race/Ethnicity} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women in certain age groups were more likely to interview as AW than women 
in other age groups, but the specific \'93higher-risk\'94 age groups were not the same for 
women of different racial/ethnic groups (Exhibit 54). For African/American/Black 
women, all age groups from 18 to 40 were about the same, but older women were less 
likely (38%) to interview as AW, compared to the 70% \'93base rate.\'94 For Latina/Hispanic 
women, the opposite was the case. The highest proportion of women interviewing AW 
(86%) was the 14 Latina/Hispanic woman over age 40.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Type of Union and Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Looking at the CWHRS women as a whole, how she described her marital status 
was not related to the percent who interviewed as AW, compared to the 70% \'93base 
rate.\'94 However, when we consider each racial/ethnic group separately, we see that 
marital status does make a difference, but in the opposite direction for Latina/Hispanic 
women, compared to African/American/Black women or white or other women (Exhibit 
55).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 68 Latina/Hispanic women who said they were married, 72% interviewed 
as AW, a consider\-ably higher percentage than the 46 Latina/Hispanic women who said 
they were single (54%). In contrast, for African/American/Black women, 58% of the 55 
who said they were married interviewed AW, much lower than the 75% of the 317 
women who said they were single. Percents for the white or other group were in the 
same direc\-tion as for African/American/Black group, but more extreme. Thus, Latina/Hispanic who said they were married versus single were more likely to interview as AW, 
while other women who said they were single versus married were more likely to 
interview as AW.\par

household, 48% of the 208 NAW women and 34% of the 495 AW women who 
responded were living in the same household as Name. An additional eight women who 
interviewed AW (1.6%) said that they were living in the same household with their 
closest intimate partner, but that person was not Name (the selected intimate partner 
who was threatening or attacking them).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As we have discussed above, the typical use of co-residence to indicate whether 
or not a woman was estranged or had left the relationship is too simplistic to reflect the 
complexity of the lives of the CWHRS women. Many of them, 114 of the 497 women 
(23%) who interviewed AW and 77 of the 208 women (37%) who interviewed NAW, 
were in long-term, committed relationships with Name, but had never lived with him or 
her. Of the 114 who interviewed AW, Name was the current boyfriend of 45 (39%), and 
the current same-sex partner, fianc\'e9 or friend of four more. Twenty-eight (25%) of the 
couples had children, and 71 (62%) had been in the relationship for more than a year. 
Of the 77 women who interviewed NAW, Name was the current boyfriend of 55 (71%), 
and the current friend or child\'92s father of three more. Seventeen (22%) of the couples 
had children, and 47 (61%) had been in the relationship for more than a year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Was there an association between co-residence and the percent who 
interviewed AW, relative to the 70% base rate? The greatest risk was for the women 
who had lived with Name at some time in the year but were now living apart. Of these 
215 women, 92% interviewed as AW (Exhibit 56). On the other hand, the 223 women 
who had lived with Name for the entire past year and the 191 who had never lived with 
Name were less likely to interview as AW (60%). In addition, only 62% of the 458 
women who said they were in a current relationship inter\-viewed as AW, in contrast to 
87% of those who said that their relationship with Name was former.\par

current relationship who had never lived with Name (45%), followed by women in a

doesn\'92t the woman just leave? One reason for not leaving might be that Name

harm or take the children, to kill her, or to commit suicide, in order to prevent the 
woman from leaving (Exhibit 58).\par

}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The item, \'93called on the phone and hung up,\'94 was especially important for 
Latina/Hispanic women (Gamma = .844, p < .0001), with 29 of the 31 (94%) women 
who said \'93yes\'94 interviewing as AW, compared to 59 of the 107 (55%) women who said 
\'93no.\'94 The item, \'93showed up without warning, \'94 was particularly important for 
African/American/Black women (Gamma = .464, p < .0001), with 231 of the 255 (91%) 
of the women who said \'93yes\'94 interviewing as AW, compared to 108 of the 209 (52%) 
who said \'93no.\'94 Some HARASS items, such as, \'93In the past year, has an intimate partner 
threatened to harm your pet?\'94, or \'93In the past year, did an intimate partner leave notes 
on your car?\'94, were answered positively by only a small proportion of women. How\-ever, 
the women who did answer them positively were much more likely to interview as AW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \'93Not applicable\'94 responses to a few HARASS items tell us about risk factors in 
women\'92s lives. Of the 308 women who said that they had no car (the question was not 
applicable to them), 253 (82%) interviewed as AW. Similarly, of the 382 women who 
said that they had no pet, 297 (78%) interviewed as AW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It might seem that the HARASS item, \'93reported you to the authorities for taking 
drugs when you didn\'92t\'94 would be applicable only to those woman who said that they 
had never had a drug problem. However, of the 52 women who answered \'93yes\'94 to this 
item, only 19 also said that they had never had a drug problem, while 21 said that they 
had a drug problem in the past and 12 said that they had a current drug problem. 
Perhaps the intimate partner had reported them for using during a period when they 
were not using. All but one of the 52 women interviewed as AW.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Physical Health} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Overall Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was no difference in the general health of women who 
interviewed as AW versus NAW. Of the 82 women who said that their general health 
was \'93excellent,\'94 68% interviewed as AW, as did 76% of the 50 women who said that 
their general health was \'93poor.\'94 The 129 women who said that their health was \'93much 
better now\'94 than a year ago were equally likely to interview as AW as the 31 women 
who said that their health was \'93much worse now\'94 (75% and 74%). There was a slight 
difference for women who said that they \'93were limited in the past month due to a 
physical condition\'94 and other women (Chi square p = .055; Gamma = .170, p = .049). 
Of the 240 who answered \'93yes\'94 75% interviewed as AW, compared to 68% of the 463 
who answered \'93no.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a slight relationship between interviewing as AW and doctor visits, but 
only for women who had \'93never\'94 seen a doctor for their own health (before today) in the 
past year, versus women who had seen a doctor five or more times (61% of 64 versus 
74% of 249).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnancy} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Previous research shows that pregnancy is positively associated 
with the risk of battering, and that between 7% and 25% of obstetrics patients are 
abused women (Gelles, 1988; McFarlane, 1992; Gazmararian, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1996). In the 
CWHRS by comparison, 8% of the women who inter\-viewed as AW and 15% of the 
women who interviewed as NAW were pregnant at the initial interview.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Consistent with McFarlane\'92s findings that the risk of abuse is lower during preg\-
nancy but increases after the baby is born, the 74 women in the CWHRS who said that 
they were \'93pregnant now\'94 were least likely to interview as AW (57%), compared to the 
126 women who said that they had been \'93pregnant in the past year\'94 (75%) or to the 493 
who said that they had not been pregnant (71%). (Eight of the nine women who said 
that they did not know if they were pregnant interviewed as AW.) This was true, 
however, for Latina/Hispanic women only, with 46% of the 41 women who were 
pregnant at the initial interview inter\-viewing as AW compared to 73% of the 115 other 
women (Chi square p = .002; Gamma = .517, p = .003). There was no significant 
difference for either African/American/Black or for white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though a review of the literature (Petersen, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997) concluded that, \'93no 
pregnancy outcome was consistently found to be associated with violence during preg\-
nancy,\'94 in the CWHRS, pregnancy outcome was related to whether the woman inter\-
viewed as AW or NAW. Of the 95 women who inter\-viewed as AW and who had been 
pregnant in the past year, only 64 (67%) had a live birth, compared to 27 of the 32 
(84%) of the women who interviewed as NAW. This was true for women of all ages, but 
partic\-ularly true for the 61 women aged 25 and older who had been pregnant in the 
past year. All of the 15 women over age 24 who interviewed as NAW had a live birth, 
compared to only 31 (67%) of the 46 women who interviewed as AW. Most of the 
difference between AW and NAW women in their pregnancy outcome was accounted 
for by miscar\-riages, not abortions. Of the 95 women who inter\-viewed as AW and had 
been pregnant in the past year, 20 (21%) suffered a miscarriage in that pregnancy, 
compared to only two of the 32 women (6%) who inter\-viewed as NAW.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Part of the association between interviewing as AW and having a miscarriage 
could be due to delay in prenatal care (Dietz, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997). However, we know that the 
violence was directly responsible for the miscarriage in at least twelve cases. In 
detailing their calendar history, twelve of the women who interviewed as AW told us that 
they had miscarried as a result of a violent episode in the past year. In addition to these 
twelve, other women experi\-enced incidents in which Name had apparently tried to 
induce a miscarriage, but the woman did not miscarry, or it is unclear whether or not 
she miscar\-ried as a result of the violence. For example, one woman said that Name 
had beaten her \'93with a baseball bat in the stomach\'94 while she was pregnant, and 
another woman had been thrown down steps.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Drug or Alcohol Use} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There are numerous reviews of the literature relating intimate partner violence 
and intoxication (Johnson, 1996:11-13; Leonard & Roberts, 1998, 1996; Leonard, 1993; 
Fagan, 1993:172-175; Kantor & Straus, 1990; Miller, 1990; Hotaling & Sugarman, 1986: 
173-176; Fagan, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1983). Many carefully-done surveys and well-controlled studies 
find an association between living with a drinker and the risk of being assaulted by him 
(Statistics Canada, 1993), and an association between the amount of drinking and the 
likelihood that drinking will be involved in an intimate assault. Goldberg (1997) 
describes some of the cultural issues that may make it difficult for a woman who is 
being abused by a Latino/Hispanic man who abuses alcohol or drugs, as well as issues 
for treatment.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Leonard and Roberts (1998) find that the}{\plain \f1  husband\'92s drinking behavior (problem 
drinking and average daily consumption) before marriage predicted}{\plain \f1  marital aggression 
in the first year of marriage. They argue that this could be due to various causal 
\'93pathways.\'94  A heavy drinking pattern may lead to increased discord with more 
opportunities for conflict, or acute alcohol consumption in an incident may increase the 
chance and severity of violence in that incident. CWHRS incident-level data allow us to 
test the extent to which these two pathways operate.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, women whose intimate partner used drugs or had a drinking 
problem were more likely to interview as AW than those whose partner did not. Almost 
all (93%) of the 200 women who responded that their partner used drugs interviewed as 
AW, compared to 61% of the 480 women who said the partner did not. Of the 286 
women who said that their partner had \'93ever had an alcohol problem,\'94 86% interviewed 
as AW, compared to 60% of the 408 women who answered \'93no.\'94 Both of these relation\-
ships were statistically significant for women in each of the three racial/ethnic groups.}{\plain \f1 \tab Research also indicates that alcohol use, medication, or illicit drug use can be a 
coping mechanism for abused women to deal with the emotional impact of violence in 
her life, including lowering of self esteem, depression and anxiety (Johnson, 1996:202; 
Kantor & Straus, 1989:185). In the Canadian Violence Against Women Survey, a fourth 
of victims of wife assault had turned to the use of one of these substances (Rogers, 
1994).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS also found an association between the woman\'92s substance use 
and whether she interviewed as AW or NAW. Of the 566 women who said that they had 
never had a problem with alcohol, 377 (67%) interviewed as AW, compared to 85 of the 
100 (85%) who said that they had an alcohol problem in the past and 34 of the 38 
(89%) who said that they had a current problem (Chi square < .0001; Gamma .508, p < 
.0001). This was true for each of the three racial/ethnic groups. Although very few 
Latina/Hispanic women said that they had ever or currently had an alcohol problem, 
eight of the ten who said \'93ever\'94 and all of the four who said \'93currently\'94 interviewed as 
AW, compared to only 64% of the 145 other women. Similarly, for white or other 
women, nine of the 11 who said \'93ever\'94 and all of the five who said \'93currently\'94 
interviewed as AW, compared to 58% of the 50 others. Of the African/American/Black 
women, 87% who said \'93ever\'94 and 86% who said \'93currently\'94 interviewed as AW, 
compared to 69% of the 360 others (Chi square p = .001; Gamma = .477, p < .0001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The association was even stronger for the woman\'92s drug use. Of the 522 women 
in the CWHRS who said in the initial interview that they had never had a problem with 
drugs, 338 (65%) interviewed as AW. In contrast, 104 of the 126 (83%) who said that 
they had a drug problem in the past and 54 of the 56 (96%) who said that they had a 
current problem interviewed as AW (Chi square < .0001; Gamma = .569, p < .0001). 
Again, there were few Latina/Hispanic women who said that they had ever or currently 
had a drug problem (only nine and four, respectively), but all of them interviewed as 
AW, compared to 63% of the 156 who had never had a problem. Similarly, 10 of the 13 
white or other women who said \'93ever\'94 and all of the six who said \'93current\'94 interviewed 
as AW, compared to 57% of the 47 other women. Of the African/American/Black 
women, 83% who said \'93ever\'94 and 96% who said \'93currently\'94 interviewed as AW, 
compared to 67% of the 317 others (Chi square p > .0001; Gamma = .534, p < .0001).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Mental Health} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Depression} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Women with higher scores on the Depressed Feelings II scale were 
more likely to interview as AW (Exhibit 66). This does not necessarily mean that there 
was any causal relationship between being depressed and experiencing violence. How\-
ever, for all racial/ethnic groups, the great majority (91%) of women who had a \'93five\'94 
score on the Depressed Feelings II scale interviewed as AW, compared to 55% of 
women who had a \'93zero\'94 score.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Latina/Hispanic women in general were more likely than others to have a higher 
score on the Depressed Feelings II scale (see Exhibit 52, above), and those who inter\-
viewed as AW had particu\-larly high scores, with 42 of the 105 (40%) Latina/Hispanic 
women who interviewed as AW scoring four or five, compared to only four of the 54 
(7%) who interviewed as NAW (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .684). The relationship 
for African/American/Black women was also significant, but not quite as strong (Gamma 
= .480). However, the relationship for white or other women was not significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As we have seen above (\'93Sample Characteristics\'94 section), depression was 
related to substance abuse problems for CWHRS women, as research has found for 
other populations of women as well. How\-ever, even if we control for substance abuse 
problems, there was still an association between the score on the Depressed Feelings 
II scale and whether the woman interviewed as AW. Among women who said that they 
had ever had a problem with alcohol, 75% of those who scored \'93zero\'94 versus 92% of 
those who scored \'93five\'94 interviewed as AW. Among women who said that they had not 
ever had a problem with alcohol, 52% of those who scored \'93zero\'94 versus 91% of those 
who scored \'93five\'94 interviewed as AW. Similarly, among women who said that they had 
ever had a problem with drugs, 74% of those who scored \'93zero\'94 interviewed as AW 
versus 93% of those who scored \'93five\'94, while among women who said that they had not 
ever had a problem with alcohol, the comparable figures were 50% and 90%, 
respectively.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, women who said that they had ever threatened or attempted suicide 
were more likely to interview as AW (85%) compared to other women (65%). This was 
true for each racial/ethnic group, but the association was strongest for Latina/Hispanic 
women. Fully 42% of the 105 Latina/Hispanic women who interviewed AW told us they 
had threatened or attempted suicide, compared to 30% of the 337 African/American/Black women and 38% of the 42 white or other women who interviewed AW. Thus, 
practitioners who are talking with a woman who has experienced violence or a violent 
threat in the past year should be aware of the possibility that the woman may be 
suicidal.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 PTSD} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 376 CWHRS women with a PTSD diagnosis were significantly (Chi 
square p < .0001; Gamma = .620) more likely to interview as AW than the 314 women 
who did not have a PTSD diagnosis (84% versus 56%). In addition, CWHRS women 
who scored zero on the PTSD items were much less likely than women who scored 16 
or 17 to interview as AW. Less than 4% of the AW women scored zero on the PTSD, 
com\-pared with 21% of the NAW women. Of the AW women, 17% scored 16 or 17, 
compared to only 3% of the NAW women. Almost all (93.4%) of the 91 women who had 
a PTSD score or 16 or 17 (maximum was 17) at the initial interview had been physically 
abused in the past year, compared to only 30.5% of women who scored zero.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thompson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1999) found that the relationship between partner abuse and 
suicide attempts disappeared when controlled for PTSD symptoms. This suggests that 
a women becomes suicidal only when she experiences PTSD in response to the 
violence. Was this true for the CWHRS women? Among the 491 women who inter\-
viewed AW and responded to these questions, 18% of the 176 women without a PTSD 
diagnosis said that they had attempted or threatened suicide, versus 41% of the 315 
women without a PTSD diagnosis (Chi square p <.0001; Gamma = .519, p < .0001). 
Among the 194 responding women who interviewed as NAW, 8% of the 135 without a 
PTSD diagnosis said that they had attempted or threatened suicide, versus 31% of the 
59 women with a PTSD diagnosis (Chi square p .0001; Gamma = .664, p = .001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the CWHRS women, therefore, being suicidal was strongly associated with 
having a PTSD diagnosis, and both having a PTSD diagnosis and being suicidal were 
strongly associated with interviewing as AW. However, the relationship between being 
abused and being suicidal did not disappear when controlled for having a PTSD 
diagnosis. For example, among women without a PTSD diagnosis, 18% of the AW 
women versus 8% of the NAW women had attempted or threatened suicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Name\'92s Suicide Risk} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . A threat to commit suicide can be a means of exerting 
control. As we have seen in Exhibit 58, above, only 5% of the women who interviewed 
as NAW, compared to 30% of the women who interviewed as AW, said that Name had 
threatened to commit suicide if she left or refused to return to the relationship. In 
addition, women who said, in the Danger Assessment, that Name had \'93ever\'94 
threatened or tried to commit suicide were much more likely to interview as AW (Chi 
square < .0001; Gamma = .808, p < .0001). Of the 129 women who answered \'93yes,\'94 
95% interviewed as AW, compared to 65% of the 554 who said \'93no.\'94\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Presence of a Firearm in the Home} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Very few of the women interviewed in the CWHRS said that there was a firearm 
in their home (see Exhibit 53, above). Of the 641 who responded to the question and 
who were not homeless or living in a group home, only 51 (8%) said \'93yes.\'94 Of these, 36 
women interviewed as AW (70.6%), compared to 67.8% of the 590 women who did not 
have a gun in the house. Thus, having a gun in the home was not associated with inter\-
viewing as AW or NAW. How\-ever, when the firearm was kept loaded, there was a 
relationship. Many more (87%) of the 23 women who had a loaded firearm in the house 
interviewed as AW, compared to 67% of the 618 other women (Chi square p = .047; 
Gamma =.528, p = .017).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Social Support Network and Other Resources} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Social Support Network Scale} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The total Social Support Network scale, and two 
of the three subscales (Acceptance and support and Tangible help in emergencies) are 
signifi\-cant\-ly correlated with whether the woman interviewed as AW for the entire 
sample and for each racial/ethnic group (Exhibit 67). The subscale, Access to and 
knowledge of resources, is correlated with inter\-viewing as AW for the entire sample and 
for African/American/Black and Latina/Hispanic women, but does not reach significance 
for white or other women.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab  Most of the individual items that make up the SSN scale are significantly related 
to interviewing as AW (Exhibit 68). There was one exception -- the item, \'93I would know 
where to tell a friend to get help if they were harmed or beaten by their partner.\'94 This 
was not related to interviewing as AW, either for the CWHRS women as a whole or for 
any racial/ethnic group. Apparently, women who interview AW and women who 
interview NAW both know how to get help.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the item, \'93It is difficult for me to ask for help because people don\'92t 
always speak my (native) language,\'94 is not related to interviewing as AW for the entire 
sample, but is very strongly related for the Latina/Hispanic women (Chi square p = .004; 
Gamma = .497, p = .001). Of the 64 Latina/Hispanic women who said that it was difficult 
for them to ask for help because of language, 80% interviewed as AW, compared to 
57% of the 95 who said that language was not a problem for them.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Employment, Education, and Income} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There were slight differences, overall, in 
the percentage of women with different occupations who interviewed as AW. In general,

only a student (76%), compared to women who were a home\-maker (62%) or who had a 
full or part-time job (63%).{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard

}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the patterns differed for women of particular ages or racial/ethnic 
groups. Of the 116 women aged 18 to 20, those who were students were more likely to 
interview as AW than others. Of the 28 women aged 18 to 20 who were students, 82% 
inter\-viewed as AW, compared to 65% of the 31 with a job and 75% of the 48 who were 
unemployed. Of the 47 African/American/Black women who were students, 81% inter\-
viewed as AW, and 78% of the 256 who were unemployed, compared to 62% of the 
157 women who had a full or part-time job.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In contrast, the 14 Latina/Hispanic women who were students were slightly }{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  
likely to interview as AW (57%) compared to 72% of the 40 unemployed women, 66% 
of the 61 homemakers and 64% of the 44 women with a full or part-time job.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, although being a full-time homemaker, for Latina/Hispanic women, is 
negatively related to all three Support Network variables, it is not related to whether she 
interviewed as AW. There is still a significant correlation between her SSN score and 
whether she interviewed as AW, even if we control for whether she said she was a 
home\-maker or not (Partial correlation = .399, p < .0001).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It is possible that an abusive partner might prevent the woman from being 
employed out of the home. Browne, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1999) found that recent physical violence by 
a man partner decreased the odds of a woman being employed by a third. On the other 
hand, in a recent Chicago study, Lloyd and Taluc (1999) found that women who had 
been physically abused by a man intimate partner were no more likely to be currently 
unemployed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab CWHRS data show a relationship between the severity of violence in the past 
year and whether or not the women would be employed at the follow-up interview, but 
only for Latina/Hispanic women. Only 10% of the 62 Latina/Hispanic women who had 
experi\-enced less extreme violence in the past year were unemployed on follow-up, 
compared to 38% of the 13 who had experienced extreme violence (Chi square p 
=.019; Gamma =.717). However, there is no relationship between whether or not the 
woman said at the initial interview that Name had tried to get her fired (a HARASS 
item), and whether or not she was unemployed at the follow-up. Of the 33 African/American/Black women who said that Name had tried to get her fired, 45% were 
unemployed at follow-up, almost the same as the 43% of the 101 women who said that 
Name had not tried to get her fired. Three of the six Latina/Hispanic women who said 
that Name had tried to get her fired were unemployed on follow-up, compared to 7% of 
the 29 other women, but the numbers are too small to be reliable. (The number of white 
or other women is even smaller.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Among the 703 women who responded, a little less than half (45%) had not 
graduated from high school. These 317 women were significantly (Chi square p = .017; 
Gamma = .198, p = .016) more likely to interview as AW (75%) than the 386 women 
who had at least a high school education (67%). This was consistently true for all three 
racial/ethnic groups.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Having any \'93money or income that you control\'94 was not associated with the 
percent of women who interviewed as AW. Of the 562 women who said \'93yes,\'94 70% 
interviewed as AW, as did 71% of the 133 who said \'93no.\'94 Of the women who did have a 
personal income, the amount of that income was not associated with her interview 
status. Further, the amount of her household income was not associated with her 
interview status.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Place of Birth and Language} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Being born in the United States was not associated 
with interviewing as AW. Of the 58 Latina/Hispanic women born in the United States, 
66% interviewed AW, compared to 67% of the 100 born outside of the U.S. Of the 55 
white or other women born in the United States, 67% interviewed as AW, compared to 
55% of the 11 women born outside of the U.S. Only one African/American/Black 
woman was not born in the United States.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the Latina/Hispanic women, however, there was a significant (Chi square p = 
.045; Gamma = .333, p = .051) difference in the interview status of the women who 
were interviewed in Spanish (only two white or other women and no African/American/Black women were interviewed in Spanish). Of the 109 who were interviewed in 
Spanish, 79 (72%) interviewed as AW, compared to 16 of the 50 (52%) who were 
interviewed in English.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a slight but not statistically significant tendency for fewer women who 
had lived in Chicago for many years or their whole life to interview as AW, versus 
women who had lived in Chicago for four years or less, but this was only for 
Latina/Hispanic women and for white or other women. Of the 464 
African/American/Black women who responded, only ten had not lived in Chicago for 
many years, but nine of these ten inter\-viewed as AW compared to 72% of the other 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Divorce} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The woman\'92s response to the item, \'93Divorce is not acceptable in my

individual racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Having a Home} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Being homeless or living in an institution or group home at the 
time of the initial interview was strongly and significantly (Chi square < .0001; Gamma = 
.797, p < .0001) related to whether the woman interviewed as AW. Of the 60 women 
who were homeless or in an institution or group home, fully 95% interviewed as AW, 
com\-pared to 68% of the 644 other women. Of the four homeless women, three 
interviewed as AW. It is not surprising, however, that women living in an institution or 
group home would interview as AW, since some of these places were domestic 
violence shelters.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This was true of the African/American/Black women (96% of 53 versus 70% of 
413) and of the white or other women (six of seven versus 63% of 59). None of the 
Latina/Hispanic women in the CWHRS was homeless or in a group home.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: AW versus NAW Comparison} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS sample design dictated that about 70% of the women inter\-viewed 
as AW, but some groups of women were even more likely to interview as AW than this 
\'93base rate\'94 dictated. The following list reviews the characteristics that were significantly 
more likely to be true for the women who interviewed as AW, versus the women who 
interviewed as NAW. If a characteristic is not mentioned in the list below, there was no 
association with the woman\'92s interview status. When a particular group is mentioned in 
parentheses after the characteristic, such as a racial/ethnic group or pregnant women, 
that means that the characteristic was important }{\plain \i\f1 only}{\plain \f1  for that group. When no particular 
group is specified, that means that the characteristic was important for everyone.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each of the characteristics in the list was significantly associated with whether or 
not the woman interviewed as AW. That does not mean, however, that the 
characteristic caused the violence, or that the violence caused the characteristic. To 
demonstrate a causal relationship, we would have to look at all of the factors combined 
together, plus look at the time sequence of all of the factors. The suggested causal 
relationship would have to make sense; there would have to be a logical explan\-ation for 
the connection. In addition, a suggested causal relationship would be interesting from a 
practical point of view when an intervention could possibly change the \'93effect\'94 by 
changing the \'93cause.\'94 For example, even if we could find some explanation for the 
association between age and interviewing as AW, no intervention would change a 
woman\'92s age.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Whether or not we can determine any causal relationship, it is important to know 
that women who are experiencing violence at the hands of an intimate partner tend to 
have particular characteristics, concerns and needs for services. For example, those 
offering support or advice need to know that, in the CWHRS, controlling behavior and 
harassment were very strongly associated with an intimate partner\'92s violence. Practi\-
tioners talking to a woman who has been experiencing intimate partner violence should 
be aware of the high rate of miscarriage, the extremely high rate of PTSD diagnosis, 
the high rate of suicidal behavior and plans, and the high rate of depression among 
CWHRS women who interviewed as AW. Armed with this information, helping profes\-
sionals could work together across disciplines to help abused women address the 
multitude of challenges they often face.\par

\tab On the other hand, some \'93risk\'94 factors were associated in the opposite direction 
with the woman\'92s interview status. That is, women with these characteristics were 
significantly }{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to interview as AW. These factors, which might be considered 
\'93protective,\'94 were the following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- she had not ever lived with Name\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- she was pregnant at the initial interview (Latina/Hispanic women)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- she was married (African/American/Black or white or other women)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- she was single (Latina/Hispanic women)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, some factors found by other studies to be related to physical violence by 
an intimate partner were }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  associated, in either direction, with whether or not CWHRS 
women interviewed as AW. Characteristics not associated with interview status 
included the following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- the length of her relationship with Name\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- the disparity between the woman\'92s age and Name\'92s age\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- the number of children living in the woman\'92s household\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- her general health, compared to other women her age\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- knowledge of resources for domestic violence (item F10)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- whether or not she had been born in the United States\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- whether \'93divorce is not acceptable\'94 to her family\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- whether or not she had recently moved to Chicago\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Characteristics of Violence in the Past Year} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though the CWHRS found differences between women who interviewed as AW 
versus NAW, that certainly does not mean that the women who had experienced 
violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the past year were all alike in the kinds of 
violence they experienced. Quite the contrary was the case. The 4,974 incidents these 
women told us that they had suffered at the hands of Name varied widely in their char\-
acteristics. In addition, the 493 responding women varied widely in the total number of 
incidents, the life-threatening severity of those incidents, and how recently the last 
incident took place. Though each woman\'92s experi\-ence was unique, in this section, we 
describe some general patterns in the violence they experienced in the last year.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Incident Characteristics} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 4,974 incidents recorded by the 493 women who completed a calendar 
history, 12% (584 incidents) could be considered very serious and possibly life 
threatening (see Exhibit 16, above). These included 391 incidents (7.9%) in which the 
woman was severely beaten, choked, or sustained burns, broken bones or severe 
contu\-sions; 112 (2.3%) in which she was threatened with a weapon, lost consciousness 
or sustained a head injury or an internal or permanent injury; and 81 (1.6%) in which 
she was attacked with a weapon.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Twelve women miscarried their baby following a violent incident in the past year. 
One of these women was pushed downstairs by her boyfriend, one woman\'92s partner 
jumped up and down on her abdomen, and another woman was severely beaten and 
sustained broken ribs. In addition to these twelve, other women experienced incidents 
in which Name had apparently tried to induce a miscarriage, but the woman did not 
miscarry, or it is unclear whether or not she miscarried as a result of the violence. For 
example, one woman said that Name had beaten her \'93with a baseball bat in the 
stomach\'94 while she was pregnant, and another woman had been thrown down steps.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 987 of the 4,969 reported incidents (20%), the woman experienced forced 
sex. Unfortunately, in 470 of these, the interviewer did not record the type of violence or 
threat of violence involved in the incident (see Exhibit 16 and discussion, above). The 
most frequent violent setting for the other 517 forced sex incidents was the 1,143 
incidents involving a \'93threat to hit with a fist or anything else that would hurt you\'94 (23%). 
However, forced sex was also common in incidents that were severe enough to be life 
threatening. About 8% of the 391 \'93beating up\'94 incidents, 4% of the 112 weapon threat 
or extreme injury incidents, and 12% of the 81 weapon use incidents included forced 
sex.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 110 incidents, occurring to 57 women, she was restrained in the incident (\'93Did 
Name tie you up, handcuff you or restrain you?\'94). For 49 women, this happened in one 
incident, but five women experienced two or three, one woman experienced eight, one 
experienced 17, and one experienced 23 such incidents. Being restrained was associa\-
ted with some of the most severe attacks. In 30 of the 110 (27%) incidents in which the 
woman was restrained, she was beaten up or worse, com\-pared to only 554 of the 4,864 
(11%) incidents in which she was not restrained. The nine incidents involving both 
restraint and forced sex were particularly severe (Exhibit 69).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Being choked can indicate an especially high-risk incident. (As we will see in the 
analysis of the homicide data below, ten of the 57 women killed by a man partner were 
strangled to death.) The CWHRS calendar did not have a \'93choking\'94 code comparable to 
the \'93TD\'94 code for being tied down or restrained. However, we often were able to deter\-
mine if she had been choked, because incidents in which she was choked were coded 
either 3 (choked or grabbed around the neck) or 4 (when she lost consciousness), and 
inter\-viewers frequently wrote notes and explanations on the calendar about these 
incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 74 of the 4,688 incidents for which we have information, the woman was 
choked. This included 60 of the 160 incidents (37%) in which she was beaten up, 
choked, burned or seriously injured, nine of the 70 (13%) incidents in which she was 
severely injured or experienced a weapon threat, and five of the 68 (7%) incidents in 
which she experienced weapon use or wounds from a weapon. Of the 373 women with 
information, 59 (16%) had been choked at least once in the past year, eight of them 
twice, one woman three times and one woman six times. This is probably a low 
estimate, because 274 of the responding 490 clinic/hospital women (56%) said that 
Name had \'93ever\'94 tried to choke her.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Number of Incidents in the Past Year} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The average (mean) number of incidents in the past year reported by the 493 
women who completed a calendar history was just over ten per woman (10.1), but the 
number varied from only one to 172 incidents. Half of the women experienced three or 
fewer incidents (median = 3.00). A little less than a third (29%) of the 493 women told 
us about only one incident in the past year, and a little over a third (34%) told us about 
two to four incidents. However, 74 women (15%) told us about five to ten incidents and 
109 (22%) told us about more than ten. Twenty-six women (5%) reported experiencing 
at least fifty incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, the less severe incidents were more frequent than the most severe 
incidents (Exhibit 70). CWHRS women experienced as many as 171 threats of violence, 
99 slapping/pushing incidents, and 129 punching/kicking incidents. However, no 
woman experienced more than 28 beating/choking incidents, nine incidents of severe 
injury or weapon threat, or eight incidents of weapon use in the previous year. Half or 
more of the women who interviewed as AW had experienced at least one incident of 
forced sex, threat of violence, slapping or pushing without injury, or punching or kicking 
with minor injury. However, only 36% had experienced at least one incident in which 
she was beaten up, choked, burned, or seriously injured; 16% had experienced at least 
one incident in which she sustained severe or permanent injury or was threatened with 
a weapon; and 12% had experienced one or more incident in which a weapon was 
used against her.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab For example, the 61 women who had experi\-enced at least one incident in which 
she was attacked with a weapon had also experienced over eight incidents, on 
average, in which she was slapped, pushed or had something thrown at her but not 
injured. One of the 61 had experienced 99 such incidents. By comparison, the 113 
women for whom \'93slapping or pushing\'94 had been the most serious type of incident in 
the past year had experienced only 3.84 slapping/pushing incidents on average (not 
shown in Exhibit 71, above). One CWHRS woman had experienced 44 incidents in the 
previous year, of which nine were weapon threats (her partner played \'93gun games\'94 on 
her), one was forced sex with restraint, one was being beaten up, six were being 
punched or kicked, and 27 were being slapped. Therefore, one incident may not 
accurately represent the level of severity and risk of injury in the woman\'92s life. It is 
important for clinicians to realize that the severity of any single incident, such as the 
presenting incident in a clinic setting, is not necessarily indicative of the overall severity 
of abuse.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The total number of incidents of all types in the past year was related to the likeli\-
hood that at least one incident would be severe (Exhibit 72). For example, 27% of the 
143 women who told us about only one incident described being beaten up or worse in 
at least one (in this case, the only) incident, compared to 51% of the 167 women who 
told us about two, three or four incident, 58% of the 74 women who told us about five to 
ten incidents, and 66% of the 109 women who had experienced over ten incidents in 
the past year. On the other hand, the only incident was a severe incident for a 
considerable minority (27%) of the 143 women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Most Recent Incident} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Even though the severity of any given incident, including the most recent, is not 
necessarily indicative of the overall severity of the violence in the past year, the recency 
of the incident may be an important predictor of continuing violence. One of the 
precepts of time series analysis and prediction is that the best predictor of what 
happens tomorrow is what happened today.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Severity} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of the 56 women whose most recent incident was a threat of violence 
(other than a weapon threat), 19 (34%) also had experienced at least one other incident 
where she was beaten up or worse. This was also true for 37 of the 155 women (24%) 
who most recently experi\-enced being slapped, pushed, or having something thrown at 
her, and for 31 of the 116 women (27%) whose most recent incident was being 
punched or kicked, with minor injuries. Overall, a fourth to a third of women who most 
recently had experienced a less severe incident, had also experienced being beaten 
up, choked or something more severe in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, 27 of the 87 women (31%) whose most recent incident involved 
being beaten up, choked or sustaining serious injury had also experienced at least one 
other incident in the previous year where she had been threatened with a weapon, had 
a weapon used on her, or sustained very severe or permanent injury. Therefore, to 
gauge the overall severity of a woman\'92s experience of violence, it is necessary to look 
at more than only the most recently occurring incident.\par

scattered across the year. The most recent incident reported happened anywhere from 
the morning of the initial interview (four cases) to 364 days before the interview (two 
cases). Over 22% of the women (111 of the 493) had experienced at least one violent 
incident during the week before the initial interview (within six days). At least ten of 
these 111 women were visiting the clinic or hospital because of injuries sustained 
during that incident. On the other hand, half of the 493 women had experienced their 
most recent violent incident 43 or more days before the initial interview, and 107 women 
(22%) had not experienced any violence for at least 181 days.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were small but statistically significant correlations between the number of 
days between the most recent incident and the initial interview, and the most severe 
incident in the past year (Pearson r = -.136, p =.01), as well as the number of incidents 
in the past year (Pearson r = -.186, p <.01).The shorter the period in days between the 
initial interview and the last reported incident, the more incidents reported in the past 
year, and the more severe the most severe incident in the year.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Children\'92s Exposure to Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par

nine of the 81 weapon use incidents (11%), 11 of the 112 \'93weapon threat or severe 
injury\'94 incidents (10%), and 82 of the 391 \'93beating, choking or serious injury\'94 incidents 
(21%). Of the 493 responding women, 119 told us that a child was present in at least 
one incident in the past year, and 64 women said that a child was present in two or 
more incidents. One woman said that a child was present in 145 incidents in the past

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Weapons Used in Incidents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 83 (1.7%) of the 4,974 incidents, the woman was threatened with a weapon 
(14 incidents are missing this information), and in 81 (1.6%) incidents a weapon was 
used on her, a total of 164 incidents involving weapon threat or use (3.3%). In 16 of 
these 164 incidents, we do not have specific information about the type of weapon. Of 
the 148 weapon threat or use incidents for which we know the weapon type, it was a 
firearm in 64 (43%), a knife or sharp instrument in 42 (28%), a club, blunt object or belt 
in 30 (20%), a car in three (2%), and another weapon in nine (6%). Among the clubs, 
blunt objects or belts, there were three incidents in which a woman was beaten with a 
belt, four in which she was hit with a telephone, and seven in which she was beaten up 
with a baseball bat. The nine other weapons included arson fire, drowning in water, hot 
coffee, acid, bleach, two incidents of deliberate HIV transmis\-sion, and two incidents of 
poisoning with drugs.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain In the \'93hot coffee\'94 incident, the man first beat her up and kicked her, then threw a pot of hot 
coffee on her as she lay on the floor.}}}
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab These 164 incidents of weapon threat or use happened to 110 different women 
(22% of the 493 who responded), of whom 79 women experienced one incident in the 
past year, 23 experienced two, five experienced three, one experienced six and two 
exper\-ienced nine. The 64 incidents of firearm threat or use happened to only 46 
different women (9%), of whom 39 (8%) experi\-enced one such incident in the past year, 
five women experienced two, one woman experi\-enced six, and one woman 
experienced nine (Name repeatedly played \'93gun games\'94 with her). The 43 knife 
incidents happened to 40 different women, with 38 experiencing one knife incident and 
two experiencing two incidents. Eleven (24%) of the 46 women who had experienced a 
firearm incident had also experienced at least one knife incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall, very few women in the CWHRS had a handgun in their household (see 
Exhibit 53, above). However, these few women were much more likely than other 
women to have experienced a firearm threat or attack at the hands of their intimate 
partner in the past year, especially when the handgun was kept loaded. Of the 19 
women who told us that there was a loaded handgun in her household, six (32%) 
experi\-enced one or more incident with a firearm, compared to 34 of the 414 (8%) who 
lived in a home where there was no loaded firearm (Chi square p = .001; Gamma = 
.654, p = .54). By comparison, only one of the 19 women with a loaded handgun at 
home had experienced a threat or attack with a knife (5%), compared to 35 of the other 
414 women (8%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of course, we have no way of knowing whether any of the firearms in the home 
was the same weapon that was threatened or used in the incident. The risk factor is the 
same, however, whether the weapon came from the woman\'92s home or elsewhere. The 
abusing partners of women who had a loaded handgun in her home were more likely 
use a firearm to threaten or attack her, compared to the partners of women who did not 
have a loaded handgun in the home. In any case, it appears that the risk factor is not 
just having a firearm in the home, but having a loaded firearm. None of the 17 women 
who said that there was an unloaded handgun, rifle or shotgun in the home was 
threatened or attacked with a firearm in the past year by her partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A weapon was not necessary for the woman to sustain severe, life-threatening 
injury. In 15 of the incidents coded as \'93severe injury or weapon threat,\'94 the only weapon 
was the partner\'92s hands, fists or feet, but the woman\'92s injuries were very severe or 
permanent. For example, seven were choked or beaten to unconsciousness or suffered 
a concussion, one was stomped on the head and suffered permanent brain damage, 
two were stomped in the belly and genitals and required lengthy hospitaliza\-tion, one 
required reconstructive surgery to the face, and two were thrown out of a window and 
severely injured. In all of the 74 incidents in which the woman was choked, the partner 
used only hands to choke her. In ten of the 74, however, the partner not only choked 
her but also used a weapon on her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab It was much less likely for a firearm to be the weapon when the weapon was 
actually used, instead of being only threatened. A firearm was the weapon in 56 (70%) 
of the 80 weapon threats (where the weapon was known), and a knife or sharp 
instrument was the weapon in 23 (29%). However, a firearm was the weapon in only 
eight (12%) of the 68 incidents in which a weapon was actually used, and a knife or 
sharp instrument was the weapon in 19 (28%). Thus, a knife was the weapon in the 
same percent of weapon threat incidents as weapon use incidents, but a firearm was 
the weapon in a much higher percent of weapon threat incidents than weapon use 
incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One reason for this could be that the threat of a firearm was sufficient for Name 
to produce the desired effect in the woman, so that it was not \'93necessary\'94 for Name to 
actually use the firearm. Another possible reason is that these are non-fatal incidents. 
The proportion of firearms in the weapon-use category might have been higher if we 
had information about the fatal firearm incidents, but women experiencing a fatal 
incident would not have been included in the clinic/hospital sample. However, an 
estimate of this analysis is possible in the CWHRS, because we have information on 
the 87 homicide incidents. (See the Homicide Findings section, below.)\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Drug or Alcohol Use in Incidents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research suggests that the role of alcohol or drugs in violent incidents may be 
related to whether or not the partner has a substance-use problem, but the relationship 
is not perfect. For example, the Violence Against Women Survey found that 28% of 
women who said that their husbands never or rarely drank heavily, still said that the 
husband was usually drunk during an assault (Johnson, 1996: 157). More than half of 
prison or jail inmates convicted of a violent crime against an intimate were drinking or 
using drugs at the time of the offense (Greenfield, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1998:26), with 31% drinking 
only, 4% using drugs only and 20% using both substances.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, Name was drunk in 1,990 (40%) of the 4,974 reported incidents, 
high on pot in 581 (12%) and high on drugs in 1,077 (22%). In an additional six 
incidents, Name beat the woman to get money to buy drugs. The woman was drunk in 
279 (6%) of the incidents, high on pot in 180 (4%) and high on drugs in 360 (7%). 
Usually, when the woman was drunk, Name was drunk also (74% of the 279 incidents), 
when she was high on pot, Name was high on pot also (76% of the 180 incidents), and 
when she was high on drugs, Name was also high on drugs (67% of the 360 incidents).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 493 responding women, 236 (48%) had experienced at least one incident 
in which Name was drunk in the previous year, 154 experienced two or more incidents, 
46 women experi\-enced ten or more incidents, and one experienced 171. Only 62 
women (13%) experi\-enced at least one incident in which both were drunk, and the 
maximum number was 23 incidents. In contrast, 138 (28%) of the 493 women had 
experienced at least one incident in which Name was high on drugs in the previous 
year, 97 had exper\-ienced two or more, 27 had experienced ten or more, and one had 
experienced 171. Only 43 had experienced at least one incident in which both were 
high on drugs, and the maximum number was 25.\tab \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Both alcohol use and hard drug use were involved in 677 of the 4,974 incidents 
(14%). In 453 of these (67%), it was Name alone who was both drunk and high, and in 
109 (16%) both the woman and Name were drunk and high. Overall, there was no 
substance use in 44% of the 4,978 incidents, Name alone was drunk and not on pot or 
other drugs in 24%, the woman or the woman and Name were drunk and not high on 
pot or other drugs in 2%, Name alone was using drugs or a combination of substances 
in 20%, and the woman or the woman and Name were using drugs or a combination of 
substances in 10%.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Much research has found an association between substance use and the 
serious\-ness of a violent incident, such as assault (Gorney, 1989), violence against 
women (Johnson, 1995), and intimate assault (Greenfield, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 1998:16). In a study of 
67 pregnant women, McFarlane, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1998) found that the partner\'92s daily intoxication 
was strongly associated with whether he had used a gun or knife against her. Did those 
CWHRS incidents involving substance use tend to be more serious than incidents in 
which neither partner was drunk or high on drugs?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The most likely situation for the most serious incidents in the CWHRS occurred 
when the woman was drunk, either alone or with Name, and neither were high on pot or 
hard drugs (Exhibit 73).}{\plain \f1  In almost a quarter of these 104 incidents (24%), the woman 
exper\-ienced being beaten, choked, burned, or worse. (There was no difference 
between the situations in which the woman alone was drunk, and when both she and 
Name were drunk.) When only Name was drunk, and again neither was high on drugs, 
the incident was more likely to be a threat (25%) compared to when the woman was 
drunk with or without Name (3%). However, when anyone was drunk, slapping and 
pushing with no injury was the most likely kind of incident (42% when Name alone was 
drunk and 51% when the woman was drunk with or without Name).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, a weapon was threatened or used in 5% of the 104 incidents in 
which the woman was drunk, with or without Name, and she was choked or grabbed 
around the neck in 4%, much higher than for any other kind of situation. The woman 
was most likely to have been tied up or restrained in the 499 incidents in which she with 
or without Name were high on drugs or using drugs with another sub\-stance (6%). 
However, this situation was still less likely to involve being beaten up or worse, 
compared to incidents in which the woman was using alcohol only, with or without 
Name.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Was there an association between the weapon used and drug or alcohol use in 
CWHRS incident data? Of the 164 incidents in which a weapon was threatened or 
used, the woman was somewhat }{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to have been a firearm in the 72 incidents 
when substance use was involved (35%) compared to the 92 with no substance use 
(42%). In contrast, the weapon was somewhat more likely to have been a knife was in 
the 72 incidents with substance use (31%) compared to the 92 others (22%), and the 
weapon was equally likely to have been a club, blunt object or belt.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: Incidents Experienced in the Past Year} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab CWHRS women told us about close to 5,000 incidents that had happened to 
them in the past year, ranging in severity from a violent threat to life-threatening or 
permanent injury. Though the most severe incidents were generally the least frequent, 
about half of the women (48%) had experienced at least one incident in which she had 
been beaten up, choked, sustained severe or permanent injury, or was threatened or 
attacked with a weapon. The woman was restrained or tied up in 110 incidents, 
occurring to 57 women, and choked in 74 incidents, occurring to 59 women. At least 12 
women had miscarried their baby following a violent incident in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab From these incidents, we can learn the following things:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \'96 To gauge the overall severity of a woman\'92s experience of violence, it is neces\-
sary to look at incidents over a period of months. A single incident may not represent 
the overall level of severity and risk of injury in the woman\'92s life. Many women who 
experi\-enced less severe incidents had also experienced very severe incidents in the 
past year. Although only 12% of the incidents women told us about were at least as 
serious as being beaten up, choked, burned, or worse, almost half of the women had 
experienced at least one such incident in the previous year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women who told us about the most incidents were not necessarily the same 
women who had experienced the most severe incidents. When women told us about 
only one incident, for 27% that single incident involved being seriously or severely 
injured or weapon threat or use. Thus, contrary to a common belief, violent incidents did 
not necessarily begin with a less serious incident and escalate. In some cases, the first 
incident was serious enough to be life-threatening.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \'96 The total number of incidents, the greatest severity of any of the incidents, and 
the recency of the most recent incident are related to each other. In general, the fewer 
days that had passed between the last reported incident and the interview, the greater 
the total number of incidents in the past year, and the more severe the most severe 
incident that had happened.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- A child was present in 24% of the incidents, including 21% of those in which 
the woman was beaten, choked, burned or sustained serious injury.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \'96 About 3% of the incidents, happening to 22% of the women, involved the threat 
or use of any kind of weapon. In 43% of these 148 weapon threat or use incidents, the 
weapon was a firearm, and in 28%, the weapon was a knife. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Of the 80 weapon threat incidents, the weapon was a firearm in 56 (70%) and 
the weapon was a knife in 23 (29%). Of the 68 weapon use incidents, the weapon was 
a firearm in only eight (12%) and the weapon was a knife in 19 (28%). Thus, it was 
much less likely for a firearm to be the weapon when the weapon was actually used 
(12%), instead of only being threatened (70%), while a knife was the weapon in the 
same percentage of incidents where the weapon was used and where the weapon was 
only threatened. One reason for this could be that the threat of a firearm was sufficient 
for Name to produce the desired effect in the woman, so that it was not \'93necessary\'94 for 
Name to actually use the firearm.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Though very few women in the CWHRS had a loaded handgun in their house\-
hold, they were much more likely to have experi\-enced a firearm threat or attack at the 
hands of their intimate partner in the past year. However, they were no more likely to 
have experienced a knife threat or attack.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab \'96 Over half (56%) of the 4,974 incidents CWHRS women told us about, either 
she, Name, or both were drunk, high on pot, high on other drugs, or using a combina\-
tion of these substances. In 1,287 (26%), only alcohol was involved and in 1,478 (30%), 
drugs were involved, with or without alcohol. However, the association between sub\-
stance use and the severity of the incident was not strong. The 104 incidents in which 
the woman was drunk, with or without Name being drunk as well, and in which neither 
was high on pot or other drugs, tended to be the most serious.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Correlates of Severity and Number of Incidents in the Past Year} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This section begins to address issues that were the central focus of the CWHRS. 
One of the primary goals was to identify factors that indicated that an abused woman 
was in a situation in which life-threatening injury or death (of either partner) was a high 
risk. Assuming that the risk of death is greater when a woman is being frequently 
attacked with life-threatening force, in this section, we look at factors correlated with the 
number of incidents and the severity incidents in the past year, for those women who 
had experienced at least one incident of violence or violent threat. Going systematically 
through each risk and protective factor, we ask what was different between situations in 
which the abused woman had experienced at least one severe incident and situations 
in which she had not, and what was different when women had experienced many 
incidents in the past year versus one or two.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As a quick indicator of whether or not the woman had experi\-enced any incident 
of abuse that might have been life-threatening, we dichotomized the \'93Most Severe 
Incident\'94 variable (see Exhibit 72, above) into those that could easily have ended in 
death (severe) and those that probably would not have ended in death (less severe). In 
the first group, we included being \'93beaten up\'94 (when a woman says that she was 
beaten all over or \'93beaten to a pulp\'94); being choked or losing consciousness; burns, 
broken bones or severe contu\-sions; head or internal injury; permanent injury, and the 
use or threat to use a weapon (see Zimring, 1972). In the second group were incidents 
with no weapon and no injury at all or nothing more serious than minor cuts or bruises.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab About half of the CWHRS women who interviewed as AW were in the first group 
and half in the second. Although this two-category summary, of necessity, loses the 
detail of each individual woman\'92s situation (see the \'93Incident Characteristics\'94 section 
above), with it we can begin to answer some of the key questions of the study.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Age and Race/Ethnicity} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of those women who interviewed as AW, Latina/Hispanic women were the least 
likely to have been severely abused in the past year. Only 34 (32%) of the 105 Latina/Hispanic women had experienced at least one incident where they were beaten up or 
worse, compared to 180 (53%) of the 338 African/American/Black women and 22 (52%) 
of the 42 white or other women. This was true even within the six age groups (Exhibit 
74). At every age group with ten or more women, the Latina/Hispanic women who 
interviewed as AW were less likely to have experienced a severe incident in the past 
year than African/American/Black women or white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The age pattern differs by racial/ethnic group. Although African/American/Black 
women over age 40 were less likely to interview as AW (see Exhibit 54, above), among 
those who did interview as AW, older women were just as likely to have experi\-enced 
severe abuse as younger women. In contrast, though older Latina/Hispanic women 
were more likely to interview as AW, the 45 women over age 30 who did interview as 
AW were less likely (29%) to have experienced at least one severe incident than 
women who were in age groups 21 to 25 (42%) or 26 to 30 (35%). For both African/American/Black women and Latina/Hispanic women, the youngest were the least likely 
to have experienced a severe incident. Among the white or other women, the 20 
youngest women (aged 18 to 30) were not only the most likely to have interviewed as 
AW (75%), but the 15 who inter\-viewed as AW were also the most likely to have 
experienced at least one severe incident in the past year (60%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Did the woman leave because of the severity of the incidents, or did the severity 
increase when she left or tried to leave, or did both happen? Anecdotal reading of the 
500 case files has found examples of each type of situation. One woman had experi\-
enced severe violence, including being choked and beaten up, put Name out and called 
the police, after which Name called, watched, followed and threatened her daily or 
every other day for almost a year. She then saw him a few times, he attacked her 
again, and she left. At the second follow-up, which was over a year after the last violent 
incident, she was not being abused. She said, \'93I haven\'92t seen him\'94 and that she had 
called the police and cut off all contact. This illustrates that the relationship between 
leaving and severity is not simple. As many other researchers have found (Okun, 1986; 
Horton & Johnson, 1993), leaving the situation is a process.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The only relationship between leaving and the number of incidents was for the 
69 women who said that they had asked Name to leave but Name had refused. These 
women had significantly more incidents than the other women, 20.68 on average 
compared to 9.47 of the 252 women who left, 12.47 of the 51 women who asked Name 
to leave and 4.33 of the 121 women who did not leave or ask Name to leave (t test p < 
.0001, p = .068, and p <.0001, respectively). Only 13% of the 69 women experienced 
one incident but 43% experienced over ten incidents, compared to 45% and 10%, 
respective\-ly, of the 121 women who did not leave. This was true for each racial/ethnic 
group. The mean number of incidents for the 31 African/American/Black women who 
asked Name to leave but Name refused was 12.48, compared to 4.40 for the 73 woman 
who did not leave or ask Name to leave; for the Latina/Hispanic women, it was 26.74 
versus 4.49, and for the white or other women, it was 41.20 versus 4.00.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For many of the CWHRS women who interviewed as AW, Name had made 
serious threats against her life or her children\'92s safety if she tried to end the relationship 
(see Exhibit 58, above). When Name used threats to keep the woman from leaving, or 
to make her return if she had already left, she was likely to have more incidents and 
more serious incidents in the past year (Exhibit 77).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When Name threatened to harm her children, she was much more likely to have 
experienced at least one very serious incident and to have over ten incidents, though 
there was only a slight difference when Name threatened to take her children. When 
Name threatened to kill her if she left the relationship, she was twice as likely to have at 
least one severe incident and to have over ten incidents. When Name threatened to kill 
himself or herself, the difference was not as great. The relationships with incident 
severity were all consistently true for each racial/ethnic group. The relation\-ship between 
the num\-ber of incidents and Name\'92s threat to harm the kids was true only for African/American/Black women, and the relationship between the number of incidents and 
Name\'92s threat to take the kids was true only for Latina/Hispanic women.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab There was no relationship between the disparity between the woman\'92s age and 
Name\'92s age, and the number or severity of incidents in the past year. The percent of 
women who were beaten up or worse was somewhat lower (27%) for the 11 women 
who were ten or more years older than Name, and somewhat higher (73%) for the 11 
women who were 20 or more years younger than Name. How\-ever, these extremes 
represented very few cases. There was no difference in the number of incidents, except 
that the 11 women who were 20 or more years younger than Name were less likely to 
have experi\-enced at least 10 incidents (9%) versus other women (22%).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Effect of Children on Abuse Severity and Number of Incidents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For CWHRS women as a whole, there was no relationship between the number 
of children a woman had by birth and the number or severity of the incidents she had 
experi\-enced in the past year. For African/American/Black women, however, there was a 
signifi\-cant difference (Chi square = .039; Gamma = .157, p = .040), but only for 
severity, not for the number of incidents. Of the 76 African/American/Black women who 
had no children, 35 (46%) had exper\-ienced at least one \'93very severe\'94 incident in the 
past year, compared to 44 of the 68 (65%) who had four or more children.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was no association between the number of children age 18 or younger 
living in the woman\'92s household and either the severity of the incidents or the number 
of the incidents she had experienced in the previous year. There was also no 
relationship between whether Name was the stepparent of one or more of the woman\'92s 
children living at home, and the risk of a severe incident. Almost the same percent of 
the 132 who had a child that was Name\'92s stepchild and the 355 other women had at 
least one severe incident (51% and 48%). There was no difference at all for 
African/American/Black women or for white or other women, and a non-signifi\-cant 
difference for Latina/Hispanic women (45% versus 27%, respectively). In addition, there 
was no relationship between the presence of Name\'92s stepchildren and the number of 
incidents, either for the entire CWHRS sample or for any of the racial/ethnic groups.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Controlling Behavior} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The score on the five Power and Control items was strongly related to whether 
the woman had experienced at least one incident involving being beaten up or worse in 
the past year (Exhibit 79). This relationship was highly significant both for the whole 
sample and for each racial/ethnic group. The strongest differences were for those 
women who answered \'93yes\'94 to four or five of the items, compared to other women. For 
example, 63 of the 169 (37%) who scored \'93five\'94 and 46 of the 110 (42%) who scored 
\'93four\'94 had experi\-enced at least one incident of weapon use, weapon threat, or extreme 
injury in the previous year. In contrast, only 10 of the 87 (11%) who scored \'93three,\'94 11 
of the 57 (19%) who scored \'93two,\'94 three of the 49 (6%) who scored \'93one,\'94 and three of 
the 21 (14%) who scored zero had experienced at least one such incident.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab HARASS was related to the severity of the most severe incident in the past year 
(Pearson r = .453, p<.0001) and to the number of incidents in the past year (Pearson r 
= .184, p < .0001). The correlations were equally strong for African/American/Black 
women (r = .456 and .230, respectively), Latina/Hispanic women (r = .366 and .194, 
respectively) and for white or other women (r = .506 and .275, respectively). Of the 60 
women who had a HARASS score of eleven or higher, 85% had at least one incident of 
being beaten up or worse, and 47% had experienced over ten incidents in the past 
year, compared to 45% and 20%, respectively, of the 398 women who had a HARASS 
score of one to ten, and 17% and 6%, respectively, of the 35 women who had a 
HARASS score of zero.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Almost every individual HARASS item was significantly related to experiencing 
one or more severe incident in the past year, and to experiencing more than one 
incident in the past year (Exhibit 81). For details of four of the HARASS questions, 
those relating to threats if she left or did not return to the relationship, see Exhibit 77, 
above.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although some of the individual HARASS items were relevant for only a small 
group of women, such as \'93threatened to harm her pet\'94 (applied only to women with a 
pet) or \'93tried to get her fired from her job\'94 (applied only to women with a job), within that 
small group, women who answered \'93yes\'94 were much more likely to have experienced 
more severe and frequent violence. In addition, the question, \'93reported her for taking 
drugs when she doesn\'92t\'94 had some interpretation problems (see discussion of Exhibit 
65, above). In addition, women who answered \'93yes\'94 to \'93scared her with a weapon\'94 
were, of course, more likely to tell us about an incident of weapon threat or use. Aside 
from these issues, the HARASS items most strongly associated with the severity of 
violence in the past year were \'93followed her,\'94 \'93destroyed something she valued,\'94 and 
\'93frightened or threatened her friends.\'94\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Overall Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 37 women who said that their general health was \'93poor\'94 at 
the initial interview were much more likely to have experienced at least one incident 
where they were beaten up or worse (62%), compared to all (47%) of the other 456 
women. However, the difference was statistically significant only for Latina/Hispanic 
women (Chi square p = .041; Gamma = .548, p = .076). Seven of the 12 
Latina/Hispanic women (58%) whose health was \'93poor\'94 were beaten up or worse in the 
past year, versus 29% of the other 93 women. Women who answered that their health 
was \'93excellent\'94 to \'93fair\'94 did not differ from each other significantly. Without looking at the 
time sequence, we do not know whether the violence preceded her poor health, or her 
poor health preceded the violence, or both.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a significant (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .336, p < .0001) associ\-
a\-tion between the woman\'92s general health and the number of incidents in the past year. 
Only seven of the 56 women who said they had \'93excellent\'94 health (12.5%) reported 
more than ten incidents, compared to 17 of the 37 women (46%) who said they had 
\'93poor\'94 health. This relationship was significant for all three racial/ethnic groups. 
However, neither the severity nor the number of incidents was associated with the 
women\'92s health \'93now\'94 compared to a year ago, or to the number of health visits in the 
past year. The 180 women who said that they had been limited in the past month due to 
a physical condition were slightly more likely to have been severely abused (53% 
versus 46%), and to have experienced more incidents, but this was significant only for 
the number of incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnancy} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 42 women who were pregnant at the initial inter\-view were 
equally likely to have experienced at least one incident where she was beaten up or 
worse in the past year (40%) as the 93 women who had been pregnant in the previous 
year (48%) or the 349 women who had not been pregnant (49%). This was true for 
each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who answered \'93yes\'94 to the Danger Assessment question, \'93Has Name 
ever beaten you while you were pregnant?\'94 at the initial interview and who had been 
pregnant at some time in the previous year were more likely to have had a miscarriage. 
Of the 44 women who answered \'93yes,\'94 12 (27%) had a miscarriage, compared to eight 
of the 47 (17%) who answered \'93no.\'94 When these women had experienced severe 
violence, they were even more likely to have had a miscarriage. For the 43 women who 
had been pregnant and who had experienced at least one severe incident in the past 
year, eight of the 28 who said that they had been beaten while pregnant (29%) had a 
miscarriage, compared to two of the 15 (13%) who answered \'93no.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a slight difference in the number of incidents for the women who were 
pregnant at the initial interview and the women who were not. Six of the 42 pregnant 
women (14%) had experienced over ten incidents in the past year, compared to 19% of 
the 93 women who had been pregnant in the past year, and 24% of the 349 other 
women. Again, this was not statistically significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Drug or Alcohol Use} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Name\'92s drug use was strongly and significantly (Chi square 
p < .0001; Gamma = .440, p < .0001) related to the severity of past violence. Of the 186 
women who said that Name used drugs, 62% had experienced at least one incident 
where she was beaten up or worse, compared to 39% of the 291 who said \'93no.\'94 This 
was true for each racial/ethnic group. The relationship between Name\'92s alcohol use and 
the severity of past violence was similar, but not as strong. Of the 244 woman who said 
that Name had \'93ever\'94 had an alcohol problem, 55% had experienced at least one 
extremely severe incident, compared to 42% of the 244 women who said \'93no\'94 (Chi 
square p = .005; Gamma = .250, p = .005). The direction of the association was consis\-
tent for each racial/ethnic group (42% versus 25% for Latina/Hispanic women, 58% 
versus 48% for African/American/Black women, and 57% versus 47% for white or other 
women), although none of these reached statistical significance.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 118 women in the CWHRS who had \'93ever\'94 had an alcohol problem, 74 
(63%) experienced at least one incident in the past year where she was beaten up or 
worse, compared to 164 (44%) of the 375 other women ( Chi square p < .0001; Gamma 
= .369, p < .0001). This was significant only for African/American/Black women (Chi 
square p = .001; Gamma = .401, p = .001), with 68% versus 48%, respectively, having 
experienced severe violence. The direction of the association was the same, but not 
significant, for Latina/Hispanic women. However, the 14 white or other women who said 
that they had ever had an alcohol problem were less likely (43%) to have experienced 
at least one severe incident than the 28 women who had not had an alcohol problem 
(42%), though the association was not significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 157 women who had ever had a drug problem, 97 (62%) had experienced 
at least one severe incident in the past year, com\-pared to 141 of the 336 (42%) other 
women (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .382, p < .0001). While the direction of the 
relationship was consistent for all groups, it was significant (Chi square p = .008; 
Gamma = .294, p = .007) only for African/American/Black women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the Canadian Violence Against Women Survey (Rogers, 1994), substance 
abuse was more common for women who had suffered emotional abuse in addition to 
violence (31%) and for women who had suffered physical abuse serious enough to 
cause physical injury (41%). Was substance abuse more common for women who had 
suffered emotional abuse as well as violence in the CWHRS, as in the Canadian 
survey? Yes, among the 494 AW women who responded, there was a strong 
relationship between the woman\'92s score on the Power and Control scale and whether 
or not she ever had an alcohol problem or a drug problem (Exhibit 82)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Whether or not the woman \'93ever\'94 had an alcohol problem and Name\'92s controlling 
behavior interacted with each other in their association with severity. Where Name was 
extremely controlling, the woman\'92s alcohol use was unrelated to the severity of past 
incidents, but not for other women. For the 169 women who had a Power and Control 
score of five, the 56 with an alcohol problem and the 113 without were almost equally 
likely to have experienced at least one severe incident. The 80 with a drug problem 
were also about equally likely to have experi\-enced a severe incident as the 89 without. 
For the other 324 women, however, 56% of the 62 with an alcohol problem had one or 
more severe incident, compared to 33% of the 262 without (Chi square p = .001; 
Gamma .446, p = .001), and 51% of the 77 with a drug problem had one or more 
severe incident, compared to 34% of the 247 without (Chi square p = .007; Gamma 
.339, p = .009).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research also suggests that alcohol or drug use may increase the frequency of 
violence. In the Canadian Violence Against Women survey (Johnson, 1996: 155-156), 
the rate of violence was over five times higher for wives of frequent heavy drinkers than 
for wives of non\-drinkers. In the CWHRS, the number of incidents was significantly 
higher for women when Name used drugs or alcohol, though not five times higher. The 
mean number of incidents for the 186 women who said that Name had a drug problem 
was 13.5, versus 8.2 for the 291 other women (t test p = .006), and the mean number of 
incidents for the 244 women who said that Name had a drinking problem was 13.8, 
versus only 6.5 for the other 244 women (t test p < .0001).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab None of the individual SSN items was associated with severe abuse in the past 
year for the sample as a whole. The item asking women whether or not they hesitated 
to get help because of a language barrier was significant for the entire sample (Chi

\'93yes\'94 to this question and those who said \'93no\'94 were equally likely to have been severely 
abused. \tab A number of SSN items were important for African/American/Black women 
only. Those women who said that they hesitated to get help because they were

experienced serious abuse in the past year (Chi square p = .025; Gamma = .316, p =

borrow money from in an emergency were more likely to have been beaten up or worse 
(63% versus 49%, Chi square p = .018; Gamma .277, p = .016). 
African/American/Black women who said that \'93there is someone I can talk to openly 
about anything\'94 were less likely (50%) to have been severely abused, compared to the 
women who did have someone to talk to (64%) (Chi square p = .038; Gamma = .269, p

problems in my relationship\'94 were less likely to have been severely abused (49% 
versus 64%, Chi square p = .013; Gamma = .296, p = .001). The item, \'93someone 
stands by me\'94 was also significant only for African/American/Black women (49% versus 
69%, Chi square p = .004; Gamma = .384, p = .003). Finally, women who said that she

women who answered \'93no\'94 to \'93Someone I know will help me if I am in danger\'94 had over 
ten incidents in the past year, compared to the 417 women who said \'93no\'94 (33% versus

the initial interview were significantly (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .354, p < .0001) 
more likely (57%) to have experienced at least one incident in which she was beaten up 
or worse, compared to the 239 women who had a job or said they were students or 
home\-makers (39%). There was no significant difference between women who were 
employed (37%), students (46%), or homemakers (35%). This was true for each group 
of women, but significant only for African/American/Black women (Chi square p = .002; 
Gamma .322, p = .003). However, unemployment was a significant (Chi square p < 
.0001; Gamma = .497, p < .0001) risk factor only for those 233 women who had not 
graduated from high school. Two-thirds (66%) of the 127 who had not graduated from 
high school and were unemployed had experienced a severe incident, compared to 
40% of the 106 who had graduated from high school and were unemployed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Whether the woman had a job, was unemployed, was a student, or was a home\-

only for African/American/Black women. Again, however, this association was 
significant only for women who were unemployed (Chi square p = .004; Gamma = .359, 
p = .003), with 66% of the 127 unemployed and with no high school education 
experiencing a severe incident versus 48% of the 123 unemployed but with a high 
school education. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the 237 women without a high school education were significantly 
(Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .432, p < .0001) more likely to have experienced at 
over ten incidents in the past year, compared to the 2554 women with at least a high

significant for each group of women, African/American/Black women (26% versus 
15%), Latina/Hispanic women (36% versus 18%), and white or other women (43% 
versus 7%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Whether or not the women had a personal source of income that she controlled 
was not associated with the severity of the incidents in the past year, for all CWHRS 
women or for any individual group. It was associated with the number of incidents, but 
only for African/American/Black women. Of the 53 African/American/Black women who 
did not have any personal income, 36% experienced over ten incidents, compared to 
only 18% of the 284 women who had a personal source of income (Chi square p = 
.003; Gamma = .437, p = .013). The amount of personal income made no difference.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the 140 women who said that their household income was less than 
$5,000 were more likely to have experienced at least one severe incident in the past 
year than the 274 other responding women (61% versus 42%). This was true of African/American/Black women (62% of 113 versus 47% of 193), Latina/Hispanic women (47% 
of 15 versus 24% of 51), and white or other women (73% of 11 versus 46% of 24). The 
amount of household income was not associated with the number of incidents in the 
past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Place of Birth and Language} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was no association between whether a 
woman was born in the United States or elsewhere and whether she had experienced 
at last one severe incident in the past year than women born elsewhere, for all CWHRS 
women or for any separate group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Similarly, for Latina/Hispanic women, whether she interviewed in English or 
Spanish was not associated with whether she had experienced a severe incident in the 
past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, whether a woman had lived in Chicago for many years made no 
differ\-ence in the severity of abuse in the past year. However, seven of the nine African/American/Black women who had lived in Chicago less than five years had at least one 
incident where she was beaten up or worse, compared to 53% of the 328 who had lived 
in Chicago for many years (NS). There was no difference in the number of incidents in 
the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Divorce} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The woman\'92s family\'92s attitude toward divorce was related to abuse 
severity in the opposite direction to our original expectation. Of the 109 woman who 
said that divorce was not acceptable in her family, 39% experienced at least one severe 
incident, compared to 51% of the 373 other women (Chi square p = .033; Gamma = 
.231, p = .031). However, this association was statistically significant only for white or 
other women (Chi square p = .008; Gamma = .782, p = .005). Only two of the 11

any individual racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Having a Home} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of the 492 responding women who interviewed as AW, 57 were

was as severe as being beaten up or worse, compared to the other 435 women (45%) 
(Chi square p <.0001; Gamma = .512, p < .0001). This association was true only of 
African/American/Black women and white or other women, however, since none of the 
Latina/Hispanic women was homeless or living in a group home or institution. Having a 
home was not related to the number of incidents in the past year, either for the sample 
as a whole or for any individual racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The difference between the women who }{\plain \f1 told us that they had no place to go

non-significant for all CWHRS women, but strong and significant (Chi square p < .0001; 
Gamma = .558, p < .0001) for African/American/Black women. Of the 45 who said that 
they had no safe place, 78% had experienced at least one severe incident, compared 
to 50% of the other 287 African/American/Black women. On the other hand, having a 
safe place was related to the number of incidents in the past year only for 
Latina/Hispanic women. Of the 41 who said that they had no safe place, 46% had 
experienced over ten incidents, compared to 19% of the other 64 Latina/Hispanic 
women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Combinations of Risk Factors} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many of the risk factors for the number or severity of the incidents in the past 
year are strongly associated with each other. Because of this association, certain 
combina\-tions of risk factors are more strongly related to the severity or the number of 
past incidents than other combinations. Though some factors may seem to be 
important when we consider them by themselves, when we look at them in combination 
with other factors we see that they really have no effect. In addition, the configuration of 
risk factors that is significantly related to the severity of past incidents for one 
racial/ethnic group may be completely different from the most important configuration of 
risk factors for another group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In this section, we review an exploratory assessment of the effect of 
combinations of risk factors on whether or not the woman experienced at least one 
incident in the past year in which she was beaten up or worse. To do this, we used 
multiple regres\-sion, with variables measuring a similar type entered in together in 
groups, one step for each group. For example, at the first step, we entered the Power 
and Control score together with the HARASS score, and at the second step, we 
entered three measures of mental health (Depressed Feelings II, PTSD diagnosis, and 
whether she had attempted or threatened suicide). (See Exhibit 30, above, for a 
complete list of the risk factors used in these multiple regressions.) Within each step, 
we eliminated variables that did not add significantly to the model. Then we looked at 
the degree to which each step contributed significantly to increasing the accuracy of the 
model (significant R square change), and eliminated entire steps that did not contribute 
significantly to the model. This process led to the final \'93best models\'94 outlined below.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Finally, we developed separate \'93best models\'94 for women in each of the three 
racial/ethnic groups, for women who were pregnant, and for women in a same-sex 
relationship. To do this, we started with the model that was best for the entire CWHRS 
sample, and tried to fit that model to each separate group of women. When the 
\'93general\'94 model was not a good fit for a particular group, we added and subtracted 
factors until we had found a good fit.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This entire process was exploratory, and somewhat subjective. Though it did not 
produce exact estimates for the effect of each variable, the analysis did give us an idea 
of the different configurations of risk factors that are important to past abuse severity for 
different groups of women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Total CWHRS Sample} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . For the sample as a whole, the best multiple regression 
model had a multiple R of .463 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .214), and contained five factors in four steps: 1) 
the Power and Control score and the HARASS score; 2) PTSD diagnosis; 3) household 
income; and 4) length of the woman\'92s relationship with Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab HARASS was highly significant (Beta = .278; p < .0001), and the Power and 
Control score was also significant but not as strong (Beta = .126; p = .030). Women 
who had a PTSD diagnosis were also more likely to have had a serious incident (Beta = 
.112, p = .022). The higher the household income, the less likely it was that she would 
have had a very serious incident (Beta -.132, p = .003). Finally, the longer she had 
been in the relation\-\-ship with Name, the less likely that she would have had a very 
serious incident (Beta = \_.115, p = .010). Even though the length of the relationship was 
not associated with seriousness when considered by itself (see Exhibit 78, above), it did 
have a signifi\-cant association when considered in combination with other risk factors.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Equally interesting, perhaps, were the factors that were not significantly related 
to serious\-ness in the best model. The following factors were not related to whether or 
not she had experienced a very serious incident in the past year, when combined in a 
model with other risk factors for the CWHRS women as a whole: marital status, overall 
health, her alcohol or drug use, the Depressed Feelings II scale, being suicidal, having 
a loaded gun at home, her age, her personal income (even when the household income 
was not included in the model), whether she had graduated from high school, whether 
she was unem\-ployed, whether she said that her occupation was homemaker, Name\'92s 
alcohol or drug problems, whether Name had attempted or threatened suicide, her total 
children or children under 18, SSN or any of the three SSN subscales, whether she had 
a safe place, or whether she had left or tried to leave Name in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 African/American/Black Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The best multiple regression model for the 
African/American/Black women had a multiple R of .477 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .228), and contained five 
factors in four steps: 1) the HARASS score and the Power and Control scale score; 2) 
PTSD diagnosis; 3) the length of her relationship with Name; and 4) her total number of 
children.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As in the best model for the total sample, HARASS was strong and highly signifi\-
cant (Beta = .258, p < .0001), while Name\'92s controlling behavior was weaker but still 
significant (Beta = .128, p = .045). PTSD diagnosis was an important factor (Beta = 
.178, p < .001), but depression was not. As in the total sample, the longer the 
relationship, the less likely she was to have had at least one very severe incident (Beta 
= -.135, p = .007). In addition, African/American/Black women with more children were 
more likely to have experienced severe abuse (Beta = .114, p = .023).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Latina/Hispanic Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The best multiple regression model of risk factors for 
serious violence in the past was very different}{\plain \f1  for the Latina/Hispanic women}{\plain \f1 . 
Compared to the best model for the total CWHRS sample, Name\'92s controlling behavior 
was not a factor in the model, none of the mental health factors was significant, and 
neither her household income nor the length of her relationship with Name was 
important. Though it was almost completely different, however, the best model for the 
Latina/Hispanic women was equally strong, with a multiple R of .465 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .216). The 
best model for Latina/Hispanic women contained only three factors in three steps: 1) 
her HARASS score, 2) her general health compared to other women her age, and 3) 
whether she had left or tried to end the relationship in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For Latina/Hispanic women, her HARASS score was a strong and significant 
factor (Beta = .283, p < .0001), but the Power and Control scale score did not figure into 
the model, even when it was entered by itself without HARASS. How she rated her 
general health at the initial interview was also important for Latina/Hispanic women 
(Beta = .181, p = .047). In addition, having left or tried to ended the relationship was 
important to the model, though of borderline significance (Beta = .182, p = .061). None 
of the other factors that were explored were significant: her children, her marital status, 
her language, her education or income, social support network, alcohol and drugs, and 
so on.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 White or Other Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Again, the best multiple regression model of risk factors 
for serious violence in the past was very different for the white or other women, 
compared to the sample as a whole. In contrast to the best model for the total CWHRS 
sample, or for either of the other two racial/ethnic groups, her score on HARASS was 
not one of the significant risk factors. Instead, her score on the Power and Control scale 
was very important. Unlike other women, whether or not she ever had a problem with 
alcohol was important. Though it was almost completely different, the best model for the 
white or other women was strong. It had a multiple R of .552 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .304). It contained 
only two risk factors in two steps: 1) Power and Control score, and 2) whether she had 
ever had an alcohol problem.\par
\tab For white or other women, her score on the Power and Control scale was a very 
strong and significant risk factor (Beta = .569, p < .0001). The more Name\'92s controlling 
behavior, the more likely that she had experienced at least one severe incident in the 
past year. In addition, women who said that they had \'93ever had a problem with alcohol\'94 
were more likely to have at least one very serious incident (Beta = .327, p = .027), when 
they also were experiencing controlling behavior from Name.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnant Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The best model for the 136 women who interviewed as AW 
and who said at the initial interview that they were pregnant or had been pregnant in the 
past year was, again, very different from the best model for the total CWHRS sample. 
The best model for pregnant women was strong, with a multiple R of .528 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .279). It 
contained three risk factors in three steps: 1) her HARASS score; 2) whether or not she 
had left or tried to leave in the past year; and 3) whether there was a loaded gun in her 
house.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This was a very different model from all the others. It contained a risk factor not 
seen in any other model (a loaded gun in the house), and another risk factor that was 
important for only one other group, Latina/Hispanic women (whether she had left or 
tried to leave the relationship). Like most of the other models, HARASS was a strong 
and signifi\-cant risk factor (Beta = .453, p < .0001). Like the Latina/Hispanic women, 
pregnant women who had left or tried to leave Name were likely to have also 
experienced a very severe incident in the past year. This was important to the model, 
though of borderline significance (Beta = .147, p = .078). In addition, pregnant women 
who said that there was a loaded gun in her house were more likely to have 
experienced at least one very severe incident in the past year (Beta = .153, p = .052.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Same-Sex Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There were only 18 women in the CWHRS who were in 
a same-sex relationship with Name, not enough women to be able to conduct a multiple 
regression or other analysis combining the effect of the numerous risk factors. We ran a 
multiple regression anyway, on a purely exploratory basis, and found two risk factors, 
PTSD diagnosis and score on the SSN subscale Acceptance and Support. We then 
analyzed these two risk factors using basic cross-tabulations.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A PTSD diagnosis was a strong and statistically significant risk factor for these 
18 women (Chi square p = .001; Gamma = .967, p < .0001). Ten of the eleven women 
who had a PTSD diagnosis at the initial interview had experienced at least one very 
serious incident in the past year, compared to only one of the seven women who did 
not have a PTSD diagnosis. The woman\'92s score on the Acceptance and Support scale 
is also important (Chi square p = .040; Gamma = -.826, p = .015). Only four of the ten 
women who had \'93supportive\'94 answers to all five of the Acceptance and Support items 
had been beaten up or worse in the past year, compared to seven of the eight women 
who had from zero to four supportive answers.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In combination, however, the woman\'92s PTSD diagnosis was an important risk 
factor for women in a same-sex abusive relationship, but Acceptance and Support was 
not. Whatever their Acceptance and Support score, women who had a PTSD diagnosis 
were much more likely to have experienced severe abuse in the past year. Conversely, 
Acceptance and Support was not important once the PTSD diagnosis was taken into 
account.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: Severity and Number of Incidents in the Past Year} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This section was the first to address issues that were the central focus of the 
CWHRS: what situations indicate a high risk of serious injury or death when a woman is 
being violently abused by an intimate partner? Going systematically through each risk 
and protective factor, we looked at the association between the factor and whether or 
not an abused woman had experienced at least one severe incident, as well as whether 
she had experienced many incidents in the past year versus one or two. We then used 
an explora\-tory multi-variate analysis to ask what combinations of factors were more 
important for distinguishing those abused  women who had experienced the most 
severe violence.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to potential risk factors, the CWHRS looked at protective or support 
factors (the SSN scale and subscales, and material resources), as well as help-seeking 
activities and formal interventions. The CWHRS interview asked women about four 
types of help-seeking activity after any incident in the past year, including talking to 
someone, contacting an agency or counselor, seeking medical care (before the current 
visit), and contacting the police. Of the 492 responding women, 89 (18%) had not done 
any of these things in the past year, and 182 (37%) had sought only one type of help. 
Of these 181, the single type of help sought was usually talking to someone (79%). 
Only five women (3%) had contacted a counselor as their only type of help-seeking, 13 
(7%) had sought medical care, and 21 (12%) had contacted the police.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Even when women sought help from two or more types of resource, one of them 
was likely to be talking to someone. Of the 123 women who had tried two types of help-seeking in the past year, almost all (92%) had talked to someone plus something else -- 
22 had contacted an agency or counselor, 21 had sought medical care, and 70 had 
contacted the police, in addition to talking to someone. There were only ten women who 
had tried two types of help but had not talked to someone (eight had sought medical 
care plus contacted the police, one had sought medical care plus contacted an agency, 
and one had contacted an agency plus the police). Similarly, 63 of the 66 women (95%) 
who did three things talked to someone, including 38 who talked to someone, sought 
medical care and called the police; 15 who talked to someone, contacted an agency 
and called the police; and 10 who talked to someone, contacted an agency, and got 
medical care.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Contacting the police was the second most likely type of help-seeking for 
CWHRS women. Although only 21 women (12%) had contacted the police as their only 
type of help-seeking, 168 had contacted the police together with doing something else. 
Getting medical care was the third most likely activity, with 13 women doing it alone, 
and another 114 seeking medical care as well as doing one or more other type of help-seeking. The fewest women had contacted an agency or counselor, with only five 
women doing this as their only type of activity, and another 85 doing it in combina\-tion 
with one or more other types of help-seeking.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was a strong relationship (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .472, p < 
.0001) between the severity of incidents in the past year and the number of types of 
help-seeking activities the woman had tried. Further, this relationship was consistent 
and highly significant for each racial/ethnic group (Exhibit 84). Of the 238 women who 
had been beaten up or worse in at least one incident in the past year, 29 (12%) had 
tried all four types of help-seeking activities, compared to only four (2%) of the 253 
women whose most severe incident had been less serious. Of the 180 
African/American/Black women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous 
year, 19 (11%) had sought help from all four sources, compared to only four of the 156 
women (3%) who had not. Of the 34 Latina/Hispanic women who had experienced a 
severe incident, six (18%) had sought help from all four sources, but none of the other 
71 women, and of the 22 white or other women who had experienced a severe incident, 
three (14%) had sought help from all four sources, but none of the 20 other women.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, the 253 women who had not experienced an incident in the

not tried any type of help-seeking (22% of the 156 African/American/Black women, 30% 
of the 71 Latina/Hispanic women, 40% of the 20 white or other women, none of the 
seven women in a same-sex relationship, and 33% of the 73 pregnant women). An 
additional 92 of the 253 women (36%) had only talked to someone.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Multiple regressions, using the same methods described above, looked at the 
combined relationship between the characteristics of the violence in the past year, all of 
the risk factors described above, and the number of types of help seeking in the past 
year. For all CWHRS women, the best multiple regression model for the number of 
types of help-seeking had a Pearson R of .456 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  square = .208), and contained four 
factors in three steps: 1) whether she had experienced at least one incident in which 
she had been beaten up or worse plus her score on the HARASS scale; 2) the 
Acceptance and Support subscale of the SSN; and 3) whether she had left or tried to 
end the relationship in the past year. There was a strong associa\-tion between the 
number of types of help-seeking and having experienced at least one severe incident in 
the previous year (Beta = .235, p < .0001), her HARASS score (Beta = .189, p < .0001, 
her Acceptance and Support scale score (Beta = .172, p < .0001), and having left or 
tried to end the relation\-ship in the past year (Beta = .146, p = .001). Essentially, the 
more severe the physical abuse and stalking in the previous year, the greater the 
informal support and acceptance available to her, and when she had tried to end the 
relationship, the more types of help-seeking she had tried in the previous year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This same model was the best for African/American/Black women, with a 
Pearson R of .438 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .192). Having experienced a severe incident (Beta = .199, p < 
.0001), her HARASS score (Beta = .235, p < .0001), her Acceptance and Support scale 
score (Beta = .100, p = .047),and whether she had left or tried to end the relationship in 
the past year (Beta = .162, p = .002) were all assoc\-ia\-ted with the number of types of 
help-seeking she had tried in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For Latina/Hispanic women, the best model contained only three factors in three 
steps: 1) whether or not she had experienced at least one severe incident in the past 
year, 2) her score on the Accep\-tance and Support scale, and 3) the number of children 
aged 17 or younger living in her household. This was a strong model, with a Pearson R 
of .497 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .247). Neither HARASS nor the Power and Control scale was significant in 
the model. PTSD was not significant in the model, and neither was her depression, 
alcohol or drug problem, or whether she had left or tried to leave or end the 
relationship. However, whether she had experienced at least one severe incident was 
strongly associated with the number of types of help-seeking (Beta = .340, p < .0001), 
as were the Acceptance and Support scale (Beta = .308, p = .001). In addition, 
Latina/Hispanic women who had more children aged 17 or younger living in their 
household were more likely to seek help from more sources (Beta = .177, p = .043). 
Half of the 20 Latina/Hispanic women who had no children age 17 or younger living in 
her household had not sought any kind of help in the previous year, compared to 25% 
of the 61 women who had one, two, or three children, and 12% of the 25 women who 
had four or more children living in her household.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For white or other women, the best model also had only three factors: 1) whether 
or not she had experienced at least one severe incident in the past year, 2) her score 
on the Acceptance and Support scale, and 3) whether she had left or tried to end the 
rela\-tion\-ship in the past year. The model was strong, with a Pearson R of .643 (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = 
.414). All three factors were strongly associated with the number of types of help-seeking in the model, including having experienced a severe incident (Beta = .425, p = 
.002), Accept\-ance and Support (Beta = .316, p = .015), and leaving (Beta = .333, p = 
.011).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The best multiple regression model for pregnant women was not as strong 
(Pearson R = .380, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .144), and had only two factors. Neither the Acceptance and 
Support scale nor any of the other SSN scales, and neither HARASS nor the Power 
and Control scale was represented in the best model. However, the most severe 
incident was still very important (Beta = .287; p = .001), as was leaving or trying to end 
the relationship (Beta = .172, p = .046).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the 18 women in a same-sex relationship, we could not find any variable that 
was related to the types of help-seeking activities. Even the severity of incidents in the 
past year was not related to types of help seeking. Though only one of the 18 women 
had not sought any type of help in the past year, compared to 87 of the 474 other 
women (18%), most sought only one type (61% of the 18 versus 36% of the 474). For 
eight of the eleven who had sought only one type of help, that type was talking to 
someone. None of the women had sought help from an agency or counselor as their 
only type of help-seeking, none of them had contacted the police, and three had sought 
medical care. All of the six women who sought more than one type of help had talked to 
someone, five had contacted a counselor or agency, four had sought medical help, and

}{\plain \f1 \tab The majority (72%) of the 492 responding CWHRS women said that they had 
talked about their domestic violence with someone in the past year. Those who had 
experienced one or more severe incident were significantly (Chi square p = .049; 
Gamma = .196, p = .047) more likely to have talked about the violence (76% versus 
68%). The difference was consistent for each racial/ethnic group, but not statistically 
significant (77% versus 72% for African/American/Black women, 71% versus 61% for 
Latina/Hispanic women, and 73% versus 50% for white or other women). This was also 
true for women who had been pregnant in the previous year (68% versus 57%). 
However, the eleven women in a same-sex relationship who had experienced a severe 
incident were less likely to have talked to someone about the violence (73%) compared 
to six of the seven women who had not (not significant).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Most (86%) who had talked to someone found it \'93helpful,\'94 though 12% said it 
was not helpful, and 2% said that they were not offered any help. For example, a 
woman might say that talking was not helpful because the confidant blamed her or took 
the abuser\'92s side (\'93my mother-in-law told me it was my fault and I didn\'92t understand 
him\'94). The proportions were almost exactly the same for women who had experienced a 
severe incident or not.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Regardless of the severity of the violence in the past year, more women spoke to 
a family member (61% of all 492 women who responded) or a friend or neighbor (70%) 
than to anyone else. (Note that women could mention more than one person they had 
talked to.) Eight women (2%) had talked to her partner\'92s family about the incidents. Six 
women had talked to religious clergy or a \'93spiritual counselor.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women apparently felt free to interpret the \'93who did you talk to?\'94 question to 
include anyone they considered a confidant. Five mentioned talking to a doctor both in 
answer to this question and in response to the \'93medical help\'94 question. Twenty-four 
said that they had talked with a counselor or social worker. Twenty of these 24 also 
said that they had sought help from a \'93counselor or agency,\'94 but four said \'93no\'94 in 
response to that question. Two of the four had talked about the incidents to a drug 
treatment counselor, one had asked for advice from a school counselor who had never 
called back, and one had talked to her \'93case manager\'94 who gave her \'93information about 
what to do,\'94 had not sought help from a \'93counselor\'94 because they could do \'93nothing\'94 
and she was afraid of Immigration. Four said that they had talked to the police. Three 
answered \'93yes\'94 to the question about contacting the police. The other woman said that 
she had talked to a \'93woman police officer\'94 who had told her about a shelter, but said 
that she had not con\-tacted the police. It could be that the \'93woman police officer\'94 was an 
acquaintance.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The most common reasons given for not talking about the violence were desire 
for privacy, being embarrassed, being uncomfortable discussing it, thinking that the 
incident was not that serious, and fear of retaliation. Eleven women said that someone 
knew already, but that these other people didn\'92t care or were tired of hearing about it.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 18 women in an abusive same-sex relationship were a little more likely to 
talk to someone about an incident in the past year (78%) compared to other women 
(71%), but the difference was not statistically significant.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Counselors and Helping Agencies} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Ninety (18%) of the 492 women responding had contacted an agency or 
counselor after at least one incident in the past year. Of these, 59 (66%) had contacted 
domestic violence services (shelter, crisis line or domestic violence counselor), and 35 
(38%) had contacted a different type of counselor or mental health provider.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain The CWHRS questionnaire allowed women to give multiple answers to this question. Some 
women mentioned both domestic violence and other types of counseling.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Women 
who had experienced at least one incident in which she was beaten up or worse were 
significantly (Chi square p = .002; Gamma = .355, p = .002) more likely to have sought 
help from an agency or counselor than women who had not (24% versus 13%). This 
was consistently true for each racial/ethnic group, and statistically significant for all but 
white or other women. It was also true, and significant, for women who had been 
pregnant in the past year. For women in a same-sex relationship, however, there was a 
significant (Chi square p = .001; Gamma = .394, p = .001) in the opposite direction. The 
eleven women who had been beaten up or worse were much less likely (18%) than the 
other women (three of the seven) to have contacted a counselor or helping agency.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Eighty-two percent of the women who had talked to a counselor reported that it 
had been helpful, 35% because she felt supported or felt better about herself (someone 
to talk to; they listen; relief of tension), 39% because she got information or questions 
answered, and 23% because of help making decisions (helped me work through my 
problems).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When asked why they had not contacted a counselor or agency in the past year, 
25 of the 176 women who had exper\-ienced at least one severe incident said they did 
not know any agency or how to contact them, ten had a barrier such as lack of 
insurance or language, 16 were concerned about privacy or confidentiality, 21 said that 
counseling was not needed, 19 did something else, three were prevented by Name, 12 
were afraid of retaliation, and 11 thought it would not help.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who had experienced one or more severe incident in the past year were 
significantly (Chi square p =.002; Gamma = .355, p = .002) more likely to have 
contacted an agency or counselor. Of the 238 women who had experienced being 
beaten up or worse, 24% had contacted an agency or counselor, compared to 13% of 
the 253 with only less severe incidents. Latina/Hispanic women and white or other 
women were over twice as likely to seek help from an agency or counselor if they had 
experi\-enced at least one severe incident. The difference was smaller but statistically 
significant for African/American/Black women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Arbuckle, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1996:213) suggest that alcoholism or drug addiction may make it 
more difficult for a woman to find help. They argue, for example, that some shelters 
may not accept them. If this were true in the CWHRS, it could increase women\'92s risk of 
serious injury or death. However, CWHRS women who said they \'93ever\'94 or \'93currently\'94 
had an alcohol problem or a problem with drugs were equally likely to seek help from a 
counselor or agency as women who said they did not. Of the women who contacted an 
agency or counselor, those who had an alcohol problem were somewhat less likely to 
say that the agency or counselor had been helpful (71% versus 84%), but the 
difference was not statistically significant.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Again, women in an abusive same-sex relationship were a little more likely to talk 
to some an agency or counselor about an incident in the past year (28%) compared to 
other women (18%), but the difference was not statistically significant.\par

\tab Of the 492 women who answered, 127 (26%) reported seeking medical attention 
after at least one incident in the prior year, and 15 (3%) stayed at least overnight in the 
hospital. For an additional ten women, the current visit was the first time they had 
sought medical attention after an incident. Contacting a medical provider was 
significantly (Chi square p < .001; Gamma = .673, p < .0001) more common with 
women who had experi\-enced at least one severe incident in the past year. Still, only 97 
(41%) of the 238 women who had been beaten up or worse had sought medical 
attention, compared to 12% of the 253 who had experienced less severe violence. This 
was consistently true for each racial/ethnic group, for pregnant women, and for women 
in a same-sex relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In many cases (28% of the 235 responding women who had experienced severe 
violence and 60% of the 252 women who had not), she decided not to seek medical 
care because she was \'93not hurt\'94 or \'93not hurt enough for a doctor.\'94 Even 42 of the 111 
women (38%) who had been beaten, choked, burned or suffered broken bones or other 
serious injury made this response. Some of these 42 women explained that they didn\'92t

\'93it was just a black eye,\'94 or \'93it wasn\'92t that serious.\'94 An additional 66 women (11% of the

considerations (\'93very private,\'94 \'93didn\'92t trust anyone\'94), and another nine mentioned that 
they had been \'93embarrassed.\'94 (Two women mentioned both.) For example, one woman

Fourteen of these 19 had been beaten up or worse.\par

were \'93scared,\'94 one said that she was \'93scared\'94 and the \'93hospital was too far,\'94 and one 
that she was \'93scared to tell the medical staff what happened.\'94 Another three said that 
they were afraid to go because the medical staff might call the authorities (police, 
immigration). Of these 22 women, 19 had been beaten up or worse.\par

practical barriers, such as \'93I had to go to work,\'94 \'93I couldn\'92t afford to,\'94 \'93no insurance,\'94 
\'93didn\'92t have the money,\'94 \'93didn\'92t have a baby sitter,\'94 or \'93hospital too far.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Most of the time when a woman sought medical attention, the practitioner asked 
about the circumstances of the injury. Of the 127 women who sought medical attention, 
102 (80%) said that they were \'93always\'94 asked what had happened and another nine 
(7%) said they were sometimes asked. Women who had experienced at least one very 
severe incident in the past year were more likely to say that the practitioner had asked 
what had happened. \'93They always asked\'94 83 of the 97 women (86%) with \'93beating or 
worse,\'94 but 19 of the 30 (63%) with less severe incidents in the past year.\par
\tab When the practitioner asked, 75% of the women said that they always or some\-
times disclosed the domestic violence. When they did not, it was generally because 
they were afraid of retaliation from the abuser or were embarrassed. Most women 
(79%) who told the medical staff what had happened found that the staff\'92s response 
was \'93helpful.\'94 The most common staff interventions were agency referrals, police 
notification, and formal or informal counseling.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 175 women who responded, 118 (67%) said that they found the police 
response to have been helpful. Their reasons were that the police had removed Name 
from the home (59%), \'93scared\'94 Name so that Name stayed away (10%), somehow led 
to the abuse stopping or lessening (10%), or had helped in a number of other ways (for 
example, helping her to get her clothes out of the house). Ten percent of the women 
said the police had helped her leave the situation. Perceived helpfulness of the police 
inter\-ven\-tions did not vary by injury severity.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: Help-Seeking and Interventions} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This section addressed the relationship between the severity and frequency of 
the violence in the previous year and help-seeking activities and interventions in the 
previous year, for different groups of CWHRS women. The following are some key 
findings of this analysis:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Almost all women (over 90%) who had experienced severe violence had tried 
at least one type of help-seeking after an incident in the previous year (talking to 
friends, consulting an agency or counselor, seeking medical help, or contacting the 
police).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In general, those women who had experienced more severe incidents as well 
as more harassment and stalking, and who had left or tried to end the relationship in 
the past year, had tried more types of help-seeking.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Latina/Hispanic women were much less likely than others to have sought help, 
despite having experienced severe violence. In total, 21% of the Latina/Hispanic 
women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year had not sought any 
help, and well over a third (38%) had not sought help from any formal resource.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Even though women who were pregnant or who had been pregnant in the past 
year had made significantly more health-care visits, of the pregnant women who had 
experienced one or more severe incident, 32% had not sought medical help or help 
from any other formal resource after a violent incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The first type of help-seeking a woman tried was usually talking to someone.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women tended to seek counseling only when they had also sought medical 
care or contacted the police. Possibly the medical or law enforcement people helped or 
encouraged them to contact a counselor or agency.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In the CWHRS, we did not find that alcohol or drug problems prevented 
women from consulting an agency or counselor about the violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women being abused by a same-sex partner were much less likely than 
others to have contacted the police in the past year, even when the violence had been 
severe. They were more likely to have sought medical help, however.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Over 80% of women who told medical staff about the violence said that they 
received helpful advice or assistance, and 67% of those who contacted the police said 
that they were helpful.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Risk Factors for Future Violence: Continuation and Severity} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The primary goal of the CWHRS was to identify risk factors for serious injury or 
death in situations where a woman is being physically abused by an intimate partner. A 
key necessity for severe injury or death is the continuation of intimate partner violence. 
If there is never another violent incident, there can never be an incident severe enough 
to cause death. In this section, we look at factors associated with whether or not the 
violence continued in the follow-up period for the women who had interviewed as AW 
and had completed at least one follow-up interview, and if the violence did continue, 
whether at least one of the follow-up incidents was severe (potentially life-threatening).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 497 CWHRS women who interviewed as AW, we were able to interview 
323 women at least once. We were not able to reach 163 women, six did not consent to 
a follow-up, three were incarcerated, and two died before the first follow-up. The 323 
women who were followed-up did not differ in their characteristics from the 163 women 
who were not. For example, the average age of the two groups was 30.7 and 30.6, 
respectively. (For more detail, see \'93Was there Retention Bias in the Follow-up?\'94 above.) 
Of the 323 women followed-up, three did not complete a calendar history. Therefore, 
the analysis in this section was based on the remaining 320.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of these 320 CWHRS women, 319 had completed a calendar history in the initial 
interview, and 171 (54%) of these women told us about at least one violent inci\-dent in 
the follow-up period (Exhibit 85). Of the 171, 92 women (54%) told us about at least 
one incident that was as severe or more severe than being beaten up. Only 47 women 
(15%) experienced a severe incident both in the previous year and on follow-up, but an 
additional 45 women who had not experienced a severe incident in the previous year 
did experience a severe incident on follow-up. However, 67 of the 143 women (47%) 
who had experienced a severe previous incident experienced no incident at all on 
follow-up, and 29 others (20%) did not experience a severe incident.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Like the previous analysis sections, this section goes systematically through 
each risk and protective factor, looking at their relationship to continuing severe 
violence, and concludes with an exploratory multi-variate analysis. Because the focus of 
this section is the relationship between the woman\'92s experiences and situation in the 
past year and the violence she experienced in the follow-up year, the analysis relates 
data gathered at the initial interview to violence occurring in the follow-up period. It also 
relates help-seeking and interventions that occurred in the year prior to the initial 
interview to later violence. In addition to the risk factors and protective factors discussed 
in previous analysis sections, the analysis in this section adds the characteristics of the 
incidents that happened to the woman in the past year to the list of risk factors for future 
violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The \'93continuation of intimate partner violence\'94 was defined, for this analysis, as 
any violence or violent threat by an intimate partner against the woman. Some women 
were experiencing violence from a different partner than the partner discussed in the 
initial interview. As described in detail above, the CWHRS collected information on one 
partner at the initial interview (called Name). If there were two partners who threatened 
or attacked her, the woman was asked to choose one as Name. However, some 
women told us at the first follow-up interview that she had experienced physical 
violence or the threat of violence at the hands of an another intimate partner or 
partners, not Name. This person became Name2, and if she told us about an additional 
violent partner at the second follow-up interview, that person became Name3. The 
analysis presented in this section, however, did not distinguish between violence by 
Name, Name2 and Name3. This analysis was limited, but a necessary foundation for 
more detailed analysis of issues related to each violent partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the analysis presented in this section used a highly summaritive 
definition of future intimate partner violence, similar to the summaritive measures of 
past violence in the analysis in the above section. For each of the 323 women who 
were re-interviewed, no matter how long the follow-up period was, the analysis focused 
on three summary pieces of information. First, we asked whether or not the woman 
experienced any incident of violence or the threat of violence at the hands of any 
intimate partner in the follow-up period. Second, we looked at the Campbell \'93violent 
incident severity\'94 code for each follow-up incident, and determined the highest severity 
code for any incident in the follow-up period. Third, we asked whether any of these 
follow-up incidents was potentially life-threatening. The definition of \'93potentially life-threatening\'94 was the same as the defini\-tion used for the incidents in the past year: the 
incident involved being beaten up, choked, burned, or serious injury (code 3), severe or 
permanent injury or weapon threat (code 4), or weapon use or wounds from a weapon 
(code 5).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The analysis in this section did not look at the number or frequency of incidents 
in the follow-up period, because the time span for the follow-up differed for each 
woman. A detailed analysis of the time sequence and clusters of incidents in the follow-up period, like a detailed analysis of clusters of incidents in the past year, was not part 
of the analysis presented in this report. Again, however, the summary analysis 
presented below is a necessary foundation for that detailed analysis.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Violence in the Past Year as a Risk Factor for Future Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When a woman is talking to a counselor or other helping professional about the 
violence of her partner, one of the things she may mention is the number and kind of 
violent incidents she has experienced recently. Since counselors or advocates are likely 
to have this piece of information, it is important to know what it may tell them about the 
women\'92s risk for serious violence in the future. Was there anything about the violence in 
the previous year that was associated with the continuation and the severity of violence 
in the future? To answer this question, we looked at three aspects of a woman\'92s 
experience in the past year: the severity of the most severe incident, the number of 
incidents, and the recency of the most recent incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Recency} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of the three aspects of the woman\'92s experience of violence in the past 
year, the one that was most strongly associated with whether or not she would experi\-
ence intimate partner violence in the future was recency -- how many days had passed 
between the most recent incident and the initial interview. The longer the period of time, 
the more likely the woman was to escape violence on follow-up. Women who had not 
experienced any violence at the hands of their intimate partner for at least 181 days 
were much less likely to experience an incident on follow-up (Exhibit 86). For example, 
almost 80% of the 57 Latina/Hispanic women who told us about an incident that had 
happened within the last 180 days went on to experi\-ence at least one incident in the 
follow-up period, com\-pared to less than a quarter of the 17 whose most recent incident 
had happened longer ago than that.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The most recent 30 days appear to have been an especially critical period for the 
likelihood of future violence. Of the 136 women whose most recent incident had 
occurred within 30 days before the initial interview, 63% exper\-ienced at least one 
incident on follow-up, compared to 47% of the 183 whose most recent incident had 
happened longer ago (Chi square p = .006; Gamma = .306, p = .005). This relationship 
was in a consistent direction for African/American/Black women (61% versus 44%, 
respec\-tive\-ly) and for Latina/Hispanic women (75% versus 61%, respectively), but not 
for white or other women (two of six versus 40%, respectively).\par
\tab However, for those 171 women who did experience an incident on follow-up, the 
association between recency and the maxi\-mum severity of any follow-up incident was 
small and not statistically signifi\-cant. Of the 146 women whose most recent incident had 
happened within 180 days and who experienced at least one incident on follow-up, 55% 
experienced at least one severe incident, only slightly more than the 48% of the 25 
women whose most recent incident had happened longer ago (not significant). This 
was also true for the 85 women who had experienced an incident in the previous 30 
days before the initial interview (55%) versus the 86 other women (52%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Severity of Past Incidents} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In contrast to the recency of the last previous incident, 
the severity of violence in the past year was not associated with experiencing at least 
one follow-up incident. Of the 143 women who had experienced at least one incident of 
beating up or worse in the previous year, 76 (53%) experienced an incident on follow-up, almost exactly the same as the 54% of the 176 women who had experienced less 
severe incidents in the previous year. Of those women who experienced at least one 
follow-up incident, the 76 who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year 
were more likely to experience a severe incident on follow-up (62%) than the 95 who 
had not (47%). This difference approached statistical significance (Chi square p = .059; 
Gamma = .286, p = .056). However, even this association was mediated by whether or 
not the woman had left or tried to end the relationship in the past year (Exhibit 87).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The 72 women who had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left or tried to leave in the past year were somewhat 
less likely to experience one or more incident on follow-up if they had experienced a 
severe incident in the past year (56%) than if they had not (67%), but this difference 
was not statistically significant. If they did experience at least one follow-up incident, 
more (60%) of the ten women who had been beaten up or worse in the previous year 
were again beaten up or worse on follow-up, compared to 39% of the other 36 women 
(not significant).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Similarly, of the 247 women who had left or tried to end the relationship in the 
past year, 53% of the 125 who had experienced a severe incident in the past year 
experi\-enced at least one follow-up incident, slightly more than the 48% of the 122 other 
women, but not statistically significant. Of the 125 women who experienced at least one 
follow-up incident, the 66 who had experienced a severe incident in the past were 
some\-what more likely to experience a severe follow-up incident (62%) than the 59 who 
had not (53%), but again, this difference did not approach significance.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, the apparent association between the seriousness of past violence 
and the seriousness of future violence disappeared when we controlled for whether or 
not the woman had left or tried to end the relationship in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Number of Incidents in the Past Year} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 98 women who had told us about only 
one incident in the previous year were significantly (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = 
.485, p < .0001) less likely to experience at least one incident on follow-up (36%), 
compared to the 221 who had experienced more than one incident (62%), and the 120 
women who had told us about five or more incidents in the previous year were signifi\-
cant\-ly (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .431, p < .0001) more likely to experience at 
least one incident on follow-up (67%), compared to the 199 who had experienced four 
or fewer (45%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This was consis\-tently true for each racial/ethnic group (Exhibit 88), though only 
the difference between one incident and more reached statistical significance for white 
or other women. Similarly, for women who had been pregnant at the initial interview or 
in the previous year, the 24 who had experienced had only one incident in the past year 
were much less likely to experience a follow-up incident (38%) compared to the 61 who 
had experienced more than one incident (70%) (Chi square p = .005; Gamma = .599, p 
= .006). However, the 31 pregnant women who had experienced five or more incidents 
were equally likely to experience a follow-up incident (71%) as the 30 pregnant women 
who had experienced two to four incidents (70%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, of the 171 women who experienced at least one incident on 
follow-up, the 35 women who had told us about only one incident in the past year were 
not signifi\-can\-tly less likely to experience a severe incident on follow-up (46%) than the 
136 women who had experienced more than one (56%), and the 81 women who had 
told us about five or more incidents in the past year were no more likely to experience a 
severe incident (53%) than the 90 women who had told us about four or fewer (54%). 
This also was true for each racial/ethnic group and for pregnant women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Summary and Conclusions: Past Violence and Future Violence} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of these three 
factors related to violence in the previous year the recency of the last incident before 
the initial interview was the most important (Exhibit 89). For all CWHRS women taken 
together, as well as for each of the racial/ethnic groups considered separately, there 
was a fairly high and usually significant negative correlation between the number of 
days since the last incident and violence on follow-up. The correlations were particularly 
strong for Latina/Hispanic women (Pearson R = \_.422 for any incident and -.362 for a 
severe incident), compared to African/American/Black women (Pearson R = \_.176 for 
both) or for white or other women (non-significant). However, there was no significant 
correlation between the number of incidents in the past year and violence in the future, 
and the maximum severity of past incidents was correlated with future severity only for 
the total group of CWHRS women.\par

catego\-ries), all entered together in the same step in a model of the continuation and 
severity of follow-up violence (no incident, less severe incidents, at least one severe 
incident), the model was not strong for CWHRS women as a whole (R = .266, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  =

(Beta = .176, p = .004) were significant factors.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the best models were different for CWHRS women in different racial/ethnic groups. For African/American/Black women, neither the maximum severity nor 
the recency of past violent incidents was significant, only the total number of incidents 
(Beta = .205, p = .003), and the model was weaker (R = .205, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .042) than the best 
model for all CWHRS women. In contrast, for Latina/Hispanic women, neither past 
severity nor the number of incidents was significant in the model, but recency was a 
much stronger factor (Beta = -.362, p = .002) and the model was stronger (R = .362, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1

(Beta = -.430, p = .001) and the regression coeffi\-cient was higher (R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .148). The best 
model for the 25 white or other women was similar to that for the African/American/Black women, with only the recoded number of incidents a significant factor 
(Beta = .413, p = .036), but the model was stronger (R = .413, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .171).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For women who had been pregnant at the initial interview or in the previous year, 
recency was not significant in the combined model, and neither was severity. The total 
number of incidents in the past year (recoded) was the only significant factor (Beta = 
.318, p = .003). The currency of past violence was not as important for pregnant women 
as whether or not the total number of incidents in the past year was five or more.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall lessons of the analysis of the relationship between past violence and 
future violence were the following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 1. The recency of the most recent incident was an important risk factor for the 
con\-tin\-ua\-tion of violence, especially for Latina/Hispanic women. A particularly critical 
period was the last 30 days.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 2. The maximum severity of any incident in the previous year was not related to 
the continuation or the severity of violence in the follow-up period, after we had taken 
into consideration whether or not the woman had ever left or tried to end the 
relationship in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 3. The risk of continued violence was lower for women who had experienced 
only one incident in the previous year, versus women who had experienced two or 
more. It was higher for women who had experienced at least five incidents than for 
women who had experienced four or fewer.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 4. Combining all three aspects of past violence, the number of incidents in the 
past year and the recency of the most recent incident were associated with the severity 
of continued violence on follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 5. For African/American/Black women, however, it was only the number of 
incidents that was important in the combined model. For Latina/Hispanic women, it was 
only the recency of the most recent incident that was important.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab 6. For women who were pregnant or had been pregnant in the year before the 
initial interview, recency was not associated with continued violence. Instead, the 
number of incidents experienced in the past year was an important factor.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Controlling Behavior} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Only three of the 13 women (23%) who scored zero on the Power and Control 
scale were physically abused at the follow-up interview (Exhibit 90), compared to 11 of 
the 33 (33%) who scored one, 24 of the 42 (57%) who scored two, 30 of the 53 (57%) 
who scored three, 40 of the 73 (55%) who scored four, and 63 of the 106 (59%) who 
scored five (Chi square p = .032; Gamma = .194, p = .014). This pattern was consistent 
for African/American/Black women and Latina/Hispanic women, but not for white or 
other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each of the five Power and Control scale items was independently associated 
with whether or not the woman would continue to be abused on follow-up. For example, 
of the 192 women who had said at the initial interview that an intimate partner had tried 
to limit her contact with family or friends, 115 (60%) experienced violence on follow-up, 
in con\-trast to 56 of the 128 (44%) women who said that had not happened to her (Chi 
square p = .005; Gamma = .315, p = .004). Of the 171 women who did experience a 
follow-up incident, women who had said that the partner tried to limit her contact with 
family or friends were more likely to experience a severe incident on follow-up (57% 
versus 48%), but the difference was not statistically significant.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab For women who experienced at least one follow-up incident, those who had 
scored zero or one on the Power and Control scale were similar to each other, and 
women who scored two to five were similar to each other, in whether one of the follow-up incidents would be beating up or worse. The 14 women who scored zero or one 
were significantly (Chi square p = .048; Gamma = .522, p = .054) less likely to exper\-
ience a severe follow-up incident (29%) than the 157 who scored two to five (56%). This 
was consistently true for each racial/ethnic group, although the numbers were small. 
None of the six Latina/Hispanic women or the one white or other woman who scored 
zero or one and who experienced incidents on follow-up experienced a severe incident, 
and only four of the seven African/American/Black women (57%) compared to 69% of 
the 104 who scored two to five.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the two Danger Assessment items relating to Name\'92s controlling 
behavior were associated with continuing violence, especially the question, \'93Is Name 
violently and constantly jealous of you?\'94 Of the 195 women who had answered \'93yes\'94 to 
this question at the initial interview, 120 (62%) experienced intimate partner violence in 
the follow-up period, compared to 49 of the 122 (40%) who answered \'93no\'94 (Chi square 
p <.0001; Gamma = .409, p < .0001). This was consistent, and statistically significant, 
for the 141 women who had been beaten up or worse in the previous year (59% versus 
35%), and for the 175 women who had not (66% versus 42%). Of the 120 women who 
answered \'93yes\'94 to the jealousy question and experienced at least one follow-up 
incident, 56% experienced a severe incident, compared to 49% of the 49 women who 
answered \'93no,\'94 but this difference was not statistically significant. However, for the 74 
women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year, the difference was 
large (69% versus 31%) and statistically significant (Chi square p = .010; Gamma = 
.665, p = .017).\par

who had at least one incident (t test p = .017). The 92 women who experienced at least 
one follow-up incident in which she was beaten up or worse had an average HARASS

less severe follow-up violence (5.44).\par

HARASS score of 5.25 for the 104 women who had no incident on follow-up, compared 
to 6.72 for the 111 women who had at least one incident (t test p = .005). However, for 
the African/American/Black women who experienced at least one follow-up incident, 
those who experienced severe violence did not differ from other women in their average 
HARASS score. For Latina/Hispanic women and for white or other women, the average 
HARASS score was slightly higher for the women who had no follow-up incident, but 
the difference was not statistically significant.\par

were by far the least likely to experience violence on follow-up (30% versus 53% and

who had scored 11 or higher on HARASS were more likely to experience a severe 
incident (70%) compared to the 144 who had scored zero to 10 (51%), but this was of 
borderline significance (Chi square p = .060; Gamma = .396, p = .052), and there was 
no relation\-ship at all within each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 146 women who said that an intimate partner had \'93followed\'94 her in the past 
year were significantly (Chi square p = .016; Gamma = .268, p = .014) more likely to 
experience a follow-up incident (61% versus 47%), and to experience severe violence if 
they were abused (61% versus 46%, Chi square p = .060; Gamma = .282, p = .058). 
(Because of the low numbers, these relationships were significant only for African/American/Black women, but the trends were consistent for all groups.) On the other 
hand, the woman\'92s response to whether her intimate partner had \'93destroyed something 
that belongs to you or that you like very much,\'94 or to whether the partner had 
\'93frightened or threatened\'94 her friends, both of which were strongly related to the 
severity of violence in the past year, were not related either to the continuation of 
violence or to the severity of violence in the future.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Age and Racial/Ethnic Group} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall, 38% of the 26 white or other women, 52% of the 215 African/American/Black women, and fully 66% of the 74 Latina/Hispanic women con\-tinued to experience 
violence on follow-up. If they experienced a follow-up incident, 68% of the 111 African/American/Black women, 20% of the 49 Latina/Hispanic women and 50% of the 10 white 
or other women experienced a severe incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The woman\'92s age did not make a differ\-ence in the likelihood of follow-up 
violence or the likelihood that the violence would be severe for any of the three 
racial/ethnic groups, with one exception. Twelve of the 15 (80%) African/American/Black women aged 41 to 62 who experienced at least one incident on follow-up 
experienced a severe follow-up incident, higher than the 67% for the 96 women who 
were younger, but this difference was not statistically significant.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Type of Union and Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was no relationship between whether a woman said that she was married 
and whether or not the abuse would continue in the future. Of the 21 African/American/Black women who had said that they were married, 52% experienced a follow-up inci\-
dent, exactly the same as for the other 192 women; of the 37 Latina/Hispanic women 
who said they were married, 65% continued to be abused versus 68% of the other 37 
women; and three of the seven white or other women who said they were married 
continued to be abused versus 37% of the 19 other women. However, the 14 Latina/Hispanic women who said they were in a commonlaw marriage were much more likely 
to experience continuing abuse (93%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Similarly, there was no difference in the continuation of violence for women who 
said they were single, versus other women. However, if the abuse continued, African/American/Black women and white or other women who said they were single were 
more likely to experience a very severe incident in the future. Almost three-quarters 
(73%) of the 74 African/American/Black women who said they were single and 
experienced at least one follow-up incident experienced one or more severe incident, 
compared to 58% of the 36 women who had some other marital status. Four of the five 
white or other women who said they were single and who experienced at least one 
follow-up incident had a severe incident, versus one of the five who had some other 
marital status.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was an association between being in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship and 
experiencing a follow-up incident, but the association was in the opposite direction as 
was the association with the severity of incidents in the previous year. Though women 
in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship were more likely to have experi\-enced severe violence 
in the past year, they were significantly (Chi square = .001; Gamma = .365, p = .001) 
}{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to continue to experience violence in the future (43%) compared to other 
women (62%). Specifically, the 15 women who said that at the initial interview that 
Name was their ex- or former husband were less likely to experi\-ence a follow-up 
incident (40%) than the 60 women who said that Name was their husband (58%), the 
eight who said that Name was an ex- or former commonlaw husband}{\plain \f1  were less likely to 
experience a follow-up incident}{\plain \f1  (50%) than the 15 women who said that Name was their 
commonlaw husband (87%), and the 106 who said that Name was an ex- or former 
boyfriend were less likely to experience a follow-up incident (43%) the 94 women who 
said that Name was their boyfriend (62%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was an association between being in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship with 
Name and having a recent incident. Of the 213 women in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship, 
only 34% had experienced an incident within 30 days of the initial interview, compared 
to 49% of the 279 other women. Because those who had experienced a recent incident 
were more likely to experience a follow-up incident, could that have accounted for the 
association between having a follow-up incident and being in an \'93ex\'94 or former relation\-
ship? No, it did not. For the 136 women who had experienced an incident within 30 
days, 52% of the 48 in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship experienced a follow-up incident, 
com\-pared to 68% of the 88 women in other relationships. For the 183 women who had 
not experi\-enced an incident within 30 days, 39% of the 95 in an \'93ex\'94 or former 
relationship experi\-enced a follow-up incident, com\-pared to 56% of the other 88 women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, among women who did experience a follow-up incident, 
those in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship were }{\plain \i\f1 more}{\plain \f1  likely to experience a severe follow-up 
inci\-dent. Of the 171 women who experienced at least one incident, 63% of the 62 in an 
\'93ex\'94 or former relationship experienced a severe incident, compared to 49% of the 109 
women in other relationships. This did not reach significance, either for CWHRS women 
as a whole or for any racial/ethnic group, but the direction was consistent across types 
of relationship. Half of the six women with an ex- or former husband versus 23% of the 
35 with a husband exper\-ienced a severe follow-up incident, as did half of the four 
women with an ex- or former commonlaw husband versus 23% of the 13 with a 
commonlaw husband. How\-ever, the 58 women who said that Name was their boyfriend 
were more likely to experi\-ence a severe follow-up incident (71%) than the 45 women 
where Name was their ex- or former boyfriend (64%).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Same-sex Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We were able to re-interview only nine of the 18 women who had been abused 
by a same-sex partner in the past year, five of the thirteen women with a current same-sex partner and four of the five with an ex- or former same-sex partner. Only three of 
these nine were still being abused in the follow-up period (33%), two of the five in a 
current relationship and one of the four in a former relationship, compared to 168 of the 
311 (54%) other women who were followed-up (44% of the 140 in an \'93ex\'94 or former 
relation\-ship and 63% of the 171 other women). Only one of the three experienced at 
least one very severe incident on follow-up. Therefore, there were too few women being 
abused by a same-sex partner for an analysis of future violence.\par

likely to continue to experience intimate partner violence in the follow-up period (73%) 
than the other 234 women (47%). Women who had never lived with Name (44% of 80), 
women who had lived with Name in prior years (29% of 14), women who had recently 
moved in with Name (50% of 18), and women who had been living with Name in the 
past year but were living apart at the initial interview (50% of 122) were all less likely to 
experience a follow-up incident. This was true for African/American/Black women (76% 
versus 47%), Latina/Hispanic women (76% versus 54%), and white or other women 
43% versus 37%), but not significant for white or other women. It was also true 
regardless of whether or not the woman had experi\-enced at least one severe incident in 
the previous year (68% versus 49%) or had not (76% versus 45%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, for women who experienced at least one follow-up incident,

compared to other women (65%). Women in all other living situations were more likely 
to experience a severe incident than women who had lived with Name the entire year. 
All of the four women who had lived with Name in a prior year but were living apart at 
the initial inter\-view, and experienced at least one follow-up incident, experienced a 
severe follow-up incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Thus, although women who had been living with Name the entire year had the 
highest risk of continuing intimate partner violence in the future, they had the lowest risk 
of that follow-up violence being severe. This was true regardless of whether women had 
experienced severe violence in the previous year. Of the 95 women who had not 
experi\-enced at least one incident in which she had been beaten up or worse in the past 
year and who experienced at least one follow-up incident, the 41 who had lived with 
Name the entire previous year were less likely (32%) to experienced a severe incident 
on follow-up than the 54 other women (59%). Of the 76 women who had experi\-enced at 
least one incident in which she had been beaten up or worse in the past year and who 
experienced at least one follow-up incident, the 21 who had lived with Name the entire 
previous year were also less likely (38%) to experienced a severe incident on follow-up 
than the 55 other women (71%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Did attempts to leave or end the relationship increase or decrease the chance 
that the violence would continue in the future? Of the 72 women who had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left or 
tried to end the relationship in the past year, 64% experienced at least one incident on 
follow-up, compared to only 44% of the 198 women who had left. However, this 
association depended upon whether the woman had experienced severe violence in 
the past year. The 238 women who had experienced at least one incident in the past 
year in which she was beaten up or worse were significantly (Chi square p < .0001; 
Gamma = .494, p < .0001) more likely to have left or tried to end the relationship in the

the violence had been in the past?\par

likelihood that at least one would be severe for the 66 who had left or tried to leave 
(62%) in the past year compared to the ten women who had not (60%).\par

severe or not. Of the 24 who had experienced at least one severe incident in the 
previous year, 76% experi\-enced a follow-up incident, as did 77% of the 26 who had 
experienced less severe incidents in the past year. Of the 38 who did experience a

serious incidents on follow-up (Exhibit 92). When Name had threatened to harm the 
kids if she left or did not return, she was not more likely to experience a follow-up 
incident. For women who did, the incidents were more likely to be severe (67% versus 
49%), but the difference was not significant. When Name had threatened to take the 
kids if she left, she was slightly more likely to experience a follow-up incident (63%

was no increase in risk when Name had threatened to do both.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab When Name had threatened to commit suicide, there was no difference in the 
likelihood that she would experience a follow-up incident, and if she did, it was only 
slightly and non-significantly more likely to be severe (58% versus 52%). When Name 
had threatened both to kill her and to commit suicide, there was no greater risk of con\-
tinued or severe violence relative to the risk when Name had only threatened to kill her.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Length of Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 62 women who, at the initial interview, had been in a relationship with Name 
for only a year or less were significantly (Chi square p = .021; Gamma = .317, p = .022) 
}{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to experience a follow-up incident (40%) than the 258 women who had been 
in longer relation\-ships (57%). If they did experience an incident, however, they were 
slightly and not significantly more likely to experience a severe incident (60% versus 
52%). Thus, being in a short-term relationship may be seen as a protective factor 
against future violence. This is contrary to what might have been expected based on 
Okun\'92s research (1986: 196-197), in which shelter residents with relationships less than 
one year old were \'93less than half as likely to experience the immediate termination of 
cohabitation\'94 as were shelter residents with lengthier relationships. The experience of 
shelter residents may differ from the experience of CWHRS women, many of whom had 
not sought help from a shelter or from any other source.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 44 CWHRS women who had been in a rela\-tion\-ship with Name for two to 
three years (25 to 36 months), 31 (70%) experienced a follow-up incident, significantly 
(Chi square p = .024) more than any other group of women (55% of the 58 in the 
relation\-ship for 37 months to five years, 53% of the 75 women in the relationship for five 
to 15 years, and 54% of the 26 women in the relationship longer than 15 years). This 
was true both for women who were in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship (53% of the 17 who 
had been in the relationship for two to three years versus 42% of the 127 others) and 
for women who were not (81% of the 27 who had been in the relationship two to three 
years versus 58% of the 149 others).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although Okun (1986:197) found that the peak relationship length for leaving 
was five years, in the CWHRS about 54% of the women experienced continued 
violence, whether the relation\-ship had lasted three years, four years, five to fifteen 
years, or longer. Given that the violence continued, 68% of the 31 women in a 
relationship for 25 to 36 months experi\-enced at least one severe incident, compared to 
49% of the 86 women in a longer rela\-tion\-ship, and 54% of the 54 in a shorter 
relationship (not significant). Again, this was true both for women in an \'93ex\'94 or former 
relationship and for other women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Age Disparity} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 178 women who were the same age or close to the same age as Name (up 
to four years older or younger) were equally likely to experience at least one incident on 
follow-up (55%) as other women. The 98 who did experience a follow-up incident were 
somewhat less likely to experience at least one incident where they were beaten up or 
worse (49%) compared to the 73 other women (60%). However, the difference was not 
statistically significant.\par
{\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Children} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall, there was no relationship between whether or not a woman had children 
and whether she would experience a follow-up incident (54% of the 251 women with at 
least one child and 52% of the other 69 women). Of the 171 women who did experience 
a follow-up incident, the 135 with a child were somewhat less likely to experience 
severe violence (51%) than the 36 others (64%), but this difference was not statistically 
signifi\-cant. Similarly, almost exactly the same percent of the 189 women who one or 
more children under 18 living in their household (53%) and the 105 women who did not 
(54%) experienced intimate partner violence in the follow-up period. Of those who did, 
the 100 who had a child were slightly less likely to experience a severe incident (48%) 
than the 57 who did not (58%), but the difference was not statistically significant. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the direction of these relationships was different for African/American/Black women and Latina/Hispanic women. The 117 African/American/Black women 
living in a house\-hold with any children age 17 or younger were }{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to experience 
a follow-up incident (48%) than the 73 women who were not (59%), but the 59 Latina/Hispanic women with children in the household were }{\plain \i\f1 more}{\plain \f1  likely to experience a follow-up incident (69%) than the 15 women who were not (53%). However, these differences 
were not statistically significant, and there was no difference at all for white or other 
women. Similarly, though there was no association between experiencing a follow-up 
incident and whether or not she was the mother of any children, among any group of 
women, the 111 African/American/Black women who did experience a follow-up 
incident were more likely to experience a severe incident if they did not have a child 
(73% of 26) than if they did (67% of 85). However, this was not statistically significant, 
and there was no difference at all for Latina/Hispanic or for white or other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab African/American/Black women with a child who was the stepchild of Name were 
less likely to experience a follow-up incident (42% versus 56%), but Latina/Hispanic 
women with a stepchild of Name were more likely (81% versus 62%), although neither 
difference quite reached statistical significance (Exhibit 93).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab For women who did experi\-ence a follow-up incident, the 111 African/American/Black women were equally likely to experience a severe incident if they had a stepchild 
to Name (68%) or not (69%), but the 49 Latina/Hispanic women were less likely to 
experi\-ence a severe incident if they had a stepchild to Name (28%) than if they did not 
(6%) (Chi square p = .066; Gamma = .725, p = .026).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Physical Health} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Overall health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was no relationship between a woman\'92s general health at 
the initial interview and whether or not the abuse continued in the follow-up period, or 
the severity of that abuse. Although Latina/Hispanic women with \'93poor\'94 health at the 
initial interview were more likely to have experienced severe violence in the past, there 
was no association with future violence or the severity of that violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There was also no relationship between violence on follow-up and the woman\'92s 
current health compared to her health a year ago, to the number of health visits in the 
past year, or to whether she had been limited in the past month by a physical condition, 
for all CWHRS women or for any separate racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnancy} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 85 women who had been pregnant at the initial interview or in 
the previous year were more likely to experience a follow-up incident (61%) compared 
to 49% of the 227 other women, but this was of borderline significance (Chi square p = 
.062; Gamma = .236, p = .059). This pattern was con\-sis\-tent for African/American/Black 
women (57% versus 49%), Latina/Hispanic women (76% versus 61%), and white or 
other women (three of five versus 30%). However, the 164 women who did experience 
a follow-up incident were not more likely to experience at least one severe incident 
(56% versus 54%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 23 women who had been pregnant at the initial interview and were 
followed-up, four were still pregnant at the first follow-up interview, 14 had given birth, 
one had had an abortion, one a stillborn child, and three did not respond.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Alcohol or Drug Use} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Some researchers (Kantor & Straus, 1990; Dobash & Dobash, 1979; Gelles, 
1974) argue that bystanders, helping professionals, the criminal justice and health 
systems, the batterer, and the women themselves may see drunkenness as a mitigating 
factor that excuses the violence. This could set the stage for a continuing pattern of 
drunken violence. In the CWHRS, however, the percent of women who experienced 
con\-tinued violence in the follow-up period was not significantly different whether Name 
had an alcohol problem or not or a drug problem or not at the initial inter\-view.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When Name had an alcohol problem at the initial interview, there was a slightly 
greater tendency for the woman to experience a follow-up incident (58% versus 48%, 
not signifi\-cant), and if she did, to experience a severe incident (59% versus 47%, not 
signifi\-cant). This was consistent for each racial/ethnic group. \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Name\'92s drug problem at the initial inter\-view made no difference in the likelihood 
of a follow-up incident for CWHRS women as a whole (54% versus 55%), or for any 
racial/ethnic group. However, for women who did experience a follow-up incident, she 
was some\-what more likely to experience at least one severe incident when Name had a 
drug problem (60% versus 50%, not significant). This was true, however, only for the 48 
Latina/Hispanic women who experienced a follow-up incident. Of the 13 where Name 
had a drug problem, 38% experienced a severe follow-up incident, compared to 14% of 
the 45 where Name did not. This was not significant, however (Chi square p = .067; 
Gamma = .579, p = .111).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though women may use alcohol and drugs to cope with the depression and 
trauma associated with abuse, Dobash and Dobash (1979) and Miller, Downs and 
Gondoli (1989) point out that such \'93self medication\'94 may seem helpful in the short run, 
but could increase the threat of escalating seriousness in the long run. This agrees with 
Blount, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1994:174), who conclude that \'93it is reasonable to suggest as well that the 
heavy use of alcohol would certainly make it difficult for the drinker to find alternative 
ways to cope with a violent partner.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, there was no relationship between the woman saying that she 
had an alcohol problem at the initial interview and experiencing a follow-up incident 
(52% versus 54%), or saying that she had a drug problem and experiencing a follow-up 
inci\-dent (54% versus 53%). This was also true for each racial/ethnic group. Name\'92s 
con\-trolling behavior made no difference in these relationships.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the 171 women who did experience violence on follow-up, the 44 who had 
ever had an alcohol problem were more likely (66%) than the 127 who had not (50%) to 
experience severe violence on follow-up, though the difference was of borderline signifi\-
cance (Chi square p = .062; Gamma = .325, p = .056). The 54 women who had ever 
had a drug problem were signifi\-cantly (Chi square p = .050; Gamma = .320, p = .045) 
more likely (65%) to experience severe violence than the 117 who had not (49%), but 
this difference disappeared completely when controlled for racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Mental Health} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Depression} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The higher the score on the Depressed Feelings II Scale in the 
initial interview, the higher the likelihood that the woman would exper\-ience a follow-up 
incident (Chi square p = .037; Gamma = .265, p < .0001). Of the 100 women who had a 
score of zero, 41% experi\-enced a follow-up incident, compared to 66% of the 65 
women who had scored a four or five. This was also true of each racial/ethnic group. 
For the 171 who did experience a follow-up incident, however, there was no association 
between her Depressed Feelings II Scale score and whether or not she experienced at 
least one severe incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The percent of women who experienced an incident on follow-up was almost 
exactly the same for women who said that they had ever threatened or attempted 
suicide or not (57% versus 51%), regardless of the woman\'92s racial/ethnic group. There 
was also no relationship between suicide and the severity of incident(s) on follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Having a PTSD diagnosis was not only 
strongly associated with severe violence in the past year, but a past PTSD diagnosis 
was also a risk factor for continued violence on follow-up. Of the 203 women who had 
met diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the initial interview, 60% experienced at least one 
follow-up incident, com\-pared to 42% of the 116 women who did not meet the PTSD 
diagnosis (Chi square p = .002; Gamma = .346, p = .002). This was true for each 
racial/ethnic group, but the association was strongest for the 215 
African/American/Black women, and significant only for them. Of the 125 women with a 
PTSD diagnosis, 59% experienced a follow-up incident, compared to 41% of the 90 
without (Chi square p = .009; Gamma = .350, p = .008).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, for the 171 women who did experience a follow-up incident, there was 
no difference between women with a PTSD diagnosis and those without in whether 
they experienced at least one severe incident (52% versus 59%). Again, this was true 
for each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Name\'92s Risk of Suicide} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 77 women who had said that Name had \'93ever\'94 
threatened or attempted suicide were not significantly more likely to experience at least 
one follow-up incident than the 236 women who had said \'93no\'94 to that question (58% 
versus 51%). This was consistent across racial/ethnic groups. For the 171 who experi\-
enced at least one follow-up incident, there was no difference in the likelihood that one 
was severe (51% versus 54%).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Presence of a Firearm in the Home} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The presence of a loaded handgun in the home had a weak and non-significant 
association with whether the woman experienced a follow-up incident. Nine of the 13 
women with a loaded firearm in their household (69%) experienced violence on follow-up, compared to 52% of the 277 other women. However, the 171 women who 
experienced at least one incident were more likely to experience one or more severe 
incident when they had said that there was a loaded firearm in their home. Seven of the 
nine women (78%) who had a loaded firearm at home were beaten up or worse, 
compared to 49% of the 146 women who did not, but this difference did not reach 
significance (Chi square p = .097; Gamma = .565, p = .091).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, 17 of the 16 women (65%) who had experienced at least one 
incident of firearm threat or use in the previous year, compared to 53% of the 293 who 
had not, experienced a follow-up incident.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Social Support Network and Other Resources} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Johnson (1998) found that two important factors related to the cessation versus 
continuation of violence were the woman\'92s \'93attachment to others who might be able 
and willing to respond\'94 and, conversely, her isolation from a network of social support 
and assistance. Was this true among CWHRS women?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Social Support Network Scale} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There were small but significant correlations 
between the woman\'92s score on the SSN scale and each SSN subscale at the initial 
inter\-view, and whether or not she continued to experience intimate partner violence on 
follow-up. The correlations were .214 (p < .01) for the entire scale, .141 (p < .05) for 
access to and knowledge of resources, .178 (p < .01) for tangible help in emergencies, 
and .185 (p < .01) for accept\-ance and support. However, none of these correlations 
reached statisti\-cal significance for the Latina/Hispanic women or for white or other 
women. For pregnant women, the correlation with the total SSN scale was significant (R 
= .214, p < .05), but not the sub-scales. In contrast, all of the Social Support Network 
scales, except the subscale Access to and Knowledge of Resources, were signifi\-cant\-ly 
related to continuing violence for the African/American/Black women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Some of the individual items in the SSN were more strongly associated with con\-
tin\-ued violence than others, and two were not significant (Exhibit 94). Only one of the 
three items measuring access to and knowledge of resources was associated with 
follow-up violence. About half of the 221 who said that they would know where to tell a 
friend to get help experienced a follow-up incident, compared to 62% of the 98 women 
who said that they would not.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, this was true only for the 175 women who had not experienced at least 
one severe incident in the previous year. For the 143 women who had experienced 
such an incident, there was no difference. For the women who did experience an 
incident on follow-up, their answer to \'93knowing where to tell a friend\'94 was not 
associated with experi\-encing a severe follow-up incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In contrast, four of the five items in the \'93Acceptance and Support\'94 sub-scale were 
significantly related to experiencing a follow-up incident. The direction of the 
associations with F1, F2 and F4 were generally consistent for the three racial/ethnic 
groups, but statis\-ti\-cally significant only for African/American/Black women. However, 
the association with F7 (\'93supports my decisions\'94) was strong and significant for both 
African/American/Black women and Latina/Hispanic women.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 215 African/American/Black women, 64% of the 88 who said that they did 
not have someone who \'93supports my decisions\'94 experienced a follow-up incident, com\-
pared to 43% of the 127 who did (Chi square p = .003; Gamma = .392, p = .003). Of the 
74 Latina/Hispanic women, 81% of the 36 who said that they did not have someone 
who \'93supports my decisions\'94 experienced a follow-up incident, compared to 53% of the

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Help Seeking and Interventions} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In this section, we examine whether or not the woman\'92s help-seeking activities

the continuation of violence or to the severity of violence in the follow-up period.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Talking to Someone} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The 234 women who had talked to someone in the past 
year were somewhat less likely to experience violence in the follow-up year (51%) 
compared to the 86 women who had not (60%), but the difference was not statistically 
significant. For African/American/Black women, however, there was a large and 
significant (Chi square p = .036; Gamma = .328, p = .033) difference. Of the 162 
women who said that they had talked to someone, only 77 (48%) experienced a follow-up incident, compared to 64% of the 53 women who did not talk to anyone.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, for the 171 women who did experience at least one follow-up incident, 
those who had talked to someone about the violence in the past year did not differ from 
those who did not in the likelihood that one of the follow-up incidents would be severe. 
This was true for CWHRS women as a whole and for each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Counselors and Helping Agencies} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was an association between seeking 
help from a counselor or agency and whether or not the woman would experience a 
follow-up incident, but only for women who had experienced severe violence in the past 
year. Of the 143 women who had been beaten up or worse in the past year, the 36 who 
had contacted an agency or counselor were much more likely (75%) to experience an 
incident on follow-up than the 107 women who had not (46%) (Chi square p =.002; 
Gamma = .561, p = .001). This was true for African/American/Black women (82% 
versus 48%, respectively), but not true for Latina/Hispanic women (four of eight versus 
69%) or for white or other women (one of three versus 30%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, of the 171 women who experienced at least one follow-up incident, 
whether the woman had sought help from a counselor or agency the severity of the was 
not associated with experiencing a severe follow-up incident. This was true both for 
women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year and for women 
who had not. It was also true for each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Why was there an association between contacting a counselor or helping agency 
and continuing violence, for those women who had been the most severely abused in 
the past year? We have seen above that seeking counseling appeared to be a \'93last 
resort\'94 for the CWHRS women. In general, women did the other help-seeking activities 
before they sought counseling. This could be because the other sources of help had 
advised them to see a counselor. Many of the women who had sought help from a 
counseling agency had already done a lot of help-seeking. This could indicate that the 
women who sought help were in a more severe abuse situation.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In fact, of the 146 women who had experienced at least one severe incident in 
the previous year and were followed-up, 23 of the 36 women (64%) who sought help 
from a counselor had experi\-enced a permanent or life-threatening injury or been 
threatened or attacked with a weapon, compared to 57 of the 110 women (52%) who 
had not sought help. In addition, 44 of the 57 women (77%) who had sought a 
counselor\'92s help said that they thought their life might be in danger, compared to 122 of 
the 265 women (46%) who had not (Chi square p < .0001; Gamma = .597, p < .0001), 
they were more likely to have sought medical help (27% versus 12%), and they were 
more likely to have contacted the police (32% versus 21%). Thus, those severely 
abused women who had sought a counselor\'92s help in the past year had two high-risk 
characteristics - the violence in the past year tended to be even more severe than other 
severely-abused women, and they were making active efforts to obtain formal 
interventions to stop the violence. This could very well explain the continuation of the 
violence on follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Medical and Health Care} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There was no association between seeking medical 
care in the past year and the continuation of violence on follow-up, regardless of how 
severely the women had been abused in the past. This was true for CWHRS women as 
a whole and for each racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the 171 women who did experience one or more follow-up incident, however, 
the 51 who had sought medical help after an incident in the past year were significantly 
(Chi square = .028; Gamma = .363, p = .024) more likely to experience a severe follow-up incident (67%), compared to the 120 women who had not sought health care (48%). 
This was only true, however, for the 76 women who had experienced a severe incident 
in the previous year, not for the 95 who had not. For these 76 women, the 37 who had 
sought health care were more likely to experience a severe incident on follow-up (73%) 
than the 39 who had not (51%) (Chi square p = .052; Gamma = .439, p = .045).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab However, the 37 women who had experienced a severe incident and who had 
sought health care after an incident in the past year were significantly (Chi square p = 
.005; Gamma = .655, p = .002) to have said at the initial interview that they thought 
their live was in danger (86%) compared to the 39 who had not (56%). If we control for 
whether or not the woman said at the initial interview that her life was in danger, there is 
no association between having sought medical care in the past year and experiencing a 
severe follow-up incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Criminal Justice System} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Whether or not a woman would experience a follow-up 
incident was significantly (Chi square p = .038; Gamma = .239, p = .036) associated 
with whether she had contacted the police in the year before the initial interview (61% 
versus 49%). This was true for each racial/ethnic group. Also, the association was 
significant (Chi square p = .028; Gamma = .358, p = .025) only for the 143 women who 
had experi\-enced at least one severe incident in the past year. Of the 78 who had 
contacted the police (or someone else had contacted the police), 62% experienced a 
follow-up incident, compared to 43% of the 65 who had not. However, for the 171 
women who experienced at least one follow-up incident, there was no difference 
between those who had contacted the police versus those who had not in the likelihood 
that a follow-up incident would be severe.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The association between contacting the police and an increased likelihood of a 
follow-up incident may be interpreted in the same way as the association between 
seeking help from a counselor or agency and future violence. In general, women 
tended to contact the police only when they had experienced very severe violence. Like 
con\-tacting a counselor or agency, contacting the police may represent an active effort 
on the woman\'92s part to stop the violence, possibly to end the relationship. This 
combination of severe violence plus efforts to obtain formal interventions to stop the 
violence may be related to the continuation of severe violence in the future.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Combinations of Risk and Supportive Factors} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Using the same methods we used for the exploratory multiple regression 
analysis of combination of risk factors on the severity of past abuse, described above, 
we looked at combinations of risk and supportive factors as they relate to the 
continuation of violence in the future. Specifically, we looked at the combined 
relationship of risk factors and supportive factors on a three-level variable measuring 
the severity of violence on follow-up: no incidents on follow-up; incidents on follow-up 
but none as severe as being beaten up, choked, seriously injured, or attacked or 
threatened with a weapon; and at least one follow-up incident of being beaten up, 
choked or worse. Because not all of the 497 women interviewed as AW were followed-up, the number of cases in this exploratory analysis was sometimes very small.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were a few changes in the risk and supportive factors we looked at in the 
multiple regressions for the continuation of severe violence. First, we looked at the 
association of risk and supportive factors in the past year with severe violence in the 
follow-up period. Second, to the list of factors explored in the exploratory regressions 
for the severity of past violence, we added the number of types of help-seeking 
activities in the past year. Third, we added to the mix the three summaries of violence in 
the past year: the number of incidents, the greatest severity of any incident, and 
recency (the number of days prior to the initial interview when the most recent incident 
had occurred). Fourth, we began each analysis by checking to see if at the combination 
of factors that had been a good model for the severity of past violence would also be a 
good model for future violence. In most cases, it was not. We then added all the other 
possible factors to find the best model.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Total CWHRS Sample} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . For all CWHRS women who were followed-up, the best 
multiple regression model for severe violence in the future contained five factors in four 
steps: 1) the number of incidents (recoded to four categories) and the recency of inci\-
dents in the past year; 2) the Power and Control scale; 3) whether she had left or tried 
to end the relationship in the past year; and 4) whether she had sought help from an 
agency or counselor in the past year. This combination was a fairly good model (R = 
.336, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .113). Both the number of incidents (Beta = .151, p = .020) and the number 
of days since the most recent incident (Beta = -.127, p = .036) were strong factors in 
this model, as was Name\'92s controlling behavior was a strong factor (Beta = .136, p = 
.019). Women who had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left Name or tried to end the relationship in the last year 
were significantly more likely (Beta = -.125, p = .028) to experience severe violence in 
the future, and women who had sought help from an agency or counselor were 
significantly more likely (Beta = .122, p = .025) to experience severe future violence, 
when these factors were combined with the number and recency of past incidents and 
Name\'92s controlling behavior.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 African/American/Black Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The best multiple regression model for severe 
violence on follow-up for African/American/Black women was even stronger (R = .377, 
R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .142), and contained several help-seeking variables as well as other factors. The 
best model had six factors in four steps: 1) the number of incidents in the past year 
(recoded to four categories); 2) the number of her children (birth, adopted or foster); 3) 
whether she had left or tried to end the relation\-ship in the past year; and 4) whether she 
had talked to anyone, contacted an agency or counselor, or contacted the police after 
any incident in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As for the total sample of women, the number of incidents was very important 
(Beta = .178, p = .009), but recency was not. However, neither HARASS nor the Power 
and Control scale score was a significant factor. Although African/American/Black 
women with more children were more likely to have experienced severe violence in the 
previous year, they were less likely to experience severe violence in the follow-up 
period (Beta = -.148, p = .046). Like the best model for all CWHRS women, }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  having 
left or tried to end relation\-ship was an important risk factor (Beta = -.136, p = .046). 
Finally, three types of help-seeking were important factors in this model. If a woman 
had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  talked to anyone in the past year about the violence, she was more likely to 
experience a severe incident in the future (Beta = -.178, p = .012). On the other hand, 
women who }{\plain \i\f1 had}{\plain \f1  contacted an agency or counselor were more likely to exper\-ience a 
severe follow-up incident (Beta = .197, p = .004), as were women who had contacted 
the police (or someone else did) in the past year (Beta = .141, p = .049).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Latina/Hispanic Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . For the Latina/Hispanic women, the best model was 
very similar to the two other models, but much stronger (R = .536, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .287). It 
contained three factors in three steps: 1) recency of the most recent incident, 2) Name\'92s 
controlling behavior, and 3) whether she had left or tried to end the relationship in the 
past year. Recency was a very strong factor for the Latina/Hispanic women (Beta = -.382, p < .0001), as was the score on the Power and Control scale (Beta = .433, p < 
.0001). Not having left or tried to leave the relationship was of borderline significance 
(Beta = -.205, p = .073), but important to the model. None of the types of help-seeking 
was important in the multiple regression model for Latina/Hispanic women. For 
Latina/Hispanic women, then, the likelihood of severe violence in the future was higher 
when the last incident had occurred recently, Name\'92s controlling behavior was severe, 
and she had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left or tried to end the relationship in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 White or Other Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . We tried an exploratory analysis for the 26 white or other 
women, but their high school education was so important in this small group that the 
possible effect of any other factor could not be determined. Of the 17 white or other 
women with a high school education, only three (18%) experienced a follow-up incident, 
compared to 78% of the nine others. None of those with a high school education were 
beaten up or worse on follow-up, but five of women without a high school education 
were beaten up or worse.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnant Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The best model for the women who were pregnant at the 
initial interview or who had been pregnant in the previous year was fairly strong (R = 
.414, R}{\plain \super\f1 2}{\plain \f1  = .171), and contained only three factors in three steps: 1) the number of 
incidents in the past year (recoded), 2) score on the Power and Control scale, and 3) 
whether the woman had left or tried to end the relationship in the past year. The 
number of incidents was a very strong factor (Beta = .286, p = .009), though the 
number of days since the last incident was not significant in the best model for pregnant 
women. Name\'92s controlling behavior was also a strong factor (Beta = .225, p = .041), 
and }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  having left or tried to end the relationship was important to the model though of 
border\-line significance (Beta = -205, p = .054). None of the types of help-seeking was 
important in the multiple regres\-sion model for pregnant women. Pregnant women who 
had experienced more incidents in the past year, where Name was very controlling, and 
who had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  tried to leave or end the relationship were significantly more likely to 
experience severe violence in the future.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Same-Sex Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . }{\plain \f1 Because of the small number of cases, models for 
women in a same-sex abusive relationship could not be tested. }{\plain \f1 Of the 18 women being 
abused by a same-sex partner at the initial interview, only ten were followed-up, and 
that was not enough for even a tentative analysis.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: Risk Factors for Future Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This section examined whether or not the violence continued in the follow-up 
period, and if the violence continued, how severe the incidents were. The analysis 
consi\-dered each risk factor and protective factor, as well as the effect of help-seeking 
and interventions that happened in the past year. In addition, the recency, severity and 
frequency of the violence in the past year was analyzed as a risk factor for violence in 
the follow-up period. An exploratory multiple regression analysis then looked at the 
effect of all of these factors in combination.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The analysis of follow-up incidents presented in this section was highly summari\-
tive, focusing only on whether the violence continued and whether the continued inci\-
dents were very severe or life-threatening. In addition, the analysis did not differentiate 
between incidents done by the partner originally identified in the initial interview, and 
those done by a new or additional intimate partner. This kind of detailed analysis will 
rest on a founda\-tion of the descriptive, summary findings in this section.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, the woman\'92s characteristics, such as demographic characteristics, 
marital status, whether she was homeless, or her physical or mental health, were less 
important risk factors for violence in the future than for violence in the previous year. 
Instead, aspects of the violence itself, especially the recency of the violence, were 
central, as well as the extent to which Name had exhibited controlling or harassing 
behavior towards her, and whether the woman had not left or tried to end the 
relationship in past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A key finding for clinical practice was the importance of one question in 
predicting a woman\'92s risk of experiencing intimate partner violence in the follow-up 
period: \'93how long ago did the last incident happen?\'94 The most recent 30 days were an 
especially critical period, with almost two-thirds (63%) of the women who had 
experienced violence within the past month experiencing an incident on follow-up. 
Women who had experi\-enced a violent incident within the last six months (180 days) 
were also at high risk (60%). In addition, the number of days since the last incident was 
a significant factor in multiple regression models of future severe violence, for the total 
sample of CWHRS women, and for Latina/Hispanic women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This finding suggests three lines of inquiry for further analysis. First, we should 
look in more detail at the help-seeking and intervention needs of women who had 
experienced recent violence. Second, we should look in more detail at the help-seeking 
and intervention exper\-iences of those women who were successful in ending the 
violence against her. Third, we should look at the experiences of those women who had 
not experienced violence for over six months, yet who did experience continued 
violence in the future.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A second key finding concerned the effect of pregnancy on intimate partner 
violence. Even though pregnancy may have been a protective factor while the woman 
was pregnant, the risk for severe violence increased after pregnancy. The 85 women 
who had been pregnant at the initial interview or in the previous year were more likely to 
be abused at follow-up, and more likely to experience at least one severe incident on 
follow-up.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A third key finding concerned an apparent paradox in the CWHRS data. Some of 
the results seemed to indicate that women who were trying to end or leave the relation\-
ship were at higher risk, but other results seem to indicate that these women were at 
lower risk. For example, women in an \'93ex\'94 or former relationship were }{\plain \i\f1 more}{\plain \f1  likely to 
have experi\-enced severe violence in the past year, }{\plain \i\f1 less}{\plain \f1  likely to continue to experience 
violence in the future, but any future violence was }{\plain \i\f1 more}{\plain \f1  likely to be severe. Similarly, 
women who had been living with Name the entire year were more likely to continue to 
experience violence in the follow-up period, but less likely to experience severe 
violence. Women who had asked Name to leave or stay away had a lower risk of 
experiencing a follow-up incident, but if they did, they were at greater risk of severe 
violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Leaving or trying to end the relationship had a high potential gain for the woman, 
but it also had a high potential risk. In some cases, the woman stopped the violence by 
leaving or ending the relationship. In other cases, the violence did not stop when she 
left or tried to leave, and in those cases it often became more severe. Women who had 
experienced severe violence were more likely to have left or tried to end the relationship 
in the past year, and to have sought formal interventions in order to end the violence. 
However, those women who tried to end the relationship but failed, for example women 
who asked Name to leave but Name refused, were at high risk for future violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab This same reasoning may help to explain another apparent paradox in the data - 
that those severely-abused women who sought help in the past year were more likely to 
experience severe violence in the follow-up period. Women who had experienced 
severe violence in the past year and who were making active efforts to obtain formal 
interven\-tions to stop the violence, such as seeking help from a counselor or agency or 
contacting the police, were at higher risk for continued violence in the follow-up period.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab What were some of the conditions under which leaving the relationship seemed 
to be a protective factor? Women in relationships that were short-term (a year or less), 
more independent (had never lived together), and less committed (no children, not 
married) seemed to find it easier to get out of the relation\-ship, even if there was severe 
violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The following lists point out the key findings of this analysis. When a 
characteristic is not mentioned, that characteristic was not related to the continuation of 
abuse or to continued severe violence. Factors that were significant in the exploratory 
multiple regres\-sion analysis are starred (*). When a factor was important for only a 
specific group or groups, those groups are noted in parentheses. If there is no specific 
group noted, then the factor was important for everyone. All of the risk factors and 
protective factors were measured in the past year.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 HOMICIDE FINDINGS}}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The focus of the Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study was to examine risk fac\-
tors that would place a physically abused woman or her partner in immediate danger of 
death or life-threatening injury. The design of the CWHRS was based on a comparison 
of abused women with and without a lethal outcome, taking into account the interaction 
of numerous events, circumstances and intervention attempts occurring over a year. 
For example, the CWHRS addressed situations in which interven\-tions were tried, but in 
which the woman or her partner were still killed.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS was primarily concerned with situations in which a woman was 
being physically abused by her intimate partner, whatever the lethal outcome. Whether 
the woman become a homicide victim or a homicide offender, neither outcome was 
good. However, little was known about risk patterns in situa\-tions in which the woman 
becomes the offender. Is it true, as previous research (Browne, 1986; Dobash, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1 , 
1992; Wilson & Daly, 1992) has suggested, that the death of the partner is usually an 
out\-come of physical abuse against a woman? By including in the study all of the 
Chicago cases of fatal intimate partner violence in which a woman was either the 
homicide victim or the homicide offender, the CWHRS was designed to answer this 
question.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, the CWHRS was concerned with whether or not the risk factors for 
situations in which the woman became the homicide offender differed from the risk 
factors for situations in which the woman became the homicide victim. For example, 
some research had suggested that barriers to the use of support services for domestic 
violence are an important risk factor for women killing an abusive partner (Browne, 
1986; Browne & Williams, 1989). In order to build effective intervention strategies for 
both kinds of situation, it is important to know if the women homicide offenders and the 
women homicide victims had different characteristics and needs.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 1995 and 1996, 87 intimate partner homicides involving at least one woman 
aged 18 or older occurred in Chicago. (The CWHRS was not designed to include man-man intimate partner homicides.) In 57 of the 87, a woman was killed by her man 
partner, in two, a woman was killed by her woman partner, and in 28, a woman killed 
her man partner (Exhibit 95). The CWHRS gathered questionnaire information in 76 of 
these \par
}{\plain \f1 cases and information from official records on all of the 87 homicides. As detailed in the 
\'93Proxy Case Completion\'94 section above, there was no systematic bias in the cases 
completed versus not completed.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The analysis presented in this section includes all the information available for 
the question at hand. In analyses for which information is available for all 87 cases in 
the homicide sample, for example, the weapon used in the homicide or basic 
demographic information on victim and offender, the number of cases in the analysis 
was 87. Most of the analysis, however, was based only on the 76 cases for which we 
were able to gather questionnaire information as well as official record data.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The \'93Homicide Findings\'94 begin with an overview of the characteristics of the fatal 
incidents, including the circumstances surrounding the incident, the place, the weapon 
or weapons, drug or alcohol use, the availability of medical help, whether the offender 
com\-mitted suicide, and the prior history of violence or controlling behavior against the 
woman (woman victim or woman offender). The second section describes the 
characteristics of the women in the homicide sample, compared to the characteristics of 
the women in the clinic/hospital sample. The third section presents the analysis that 
determined whether characteristics of the two same-sex homicides were similar enough 
to the other women-victim homicides that they could be combined for analysis, and 
whether the woman-offender homicides and the women-victim homicides should be 
analyzed separately.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The final section addresses one of the key questions posed by the CWHRS: the 
comparison of women who have been physically abused by an intimate partner in the 
past year (the clinic/hospital women who interviewed as AW), and women who were 
also physically abused by an intimate partner, and who became a homicide victim or 
offender. In order to conduct this nonlethal-versus-lethal comparison, it was necessary 
to limit the homicide women to those who had experienced violence at the hands of 
their intimate partner in the past year. \par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Characteristics of the Fatal Incident} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though a homicide often represents the culmination of a long process of events 
occurring between victim and offender (Block & Christokos, 1995), it is defined as a 
homicide by the final incident. This fatal incident can be compared to and contrasted 
with the 4,974 incidents reported at the initial interview by the clinic/hospital women. In 
76 of the 87 homicide cases, interviews provided information about the events that had 
occurred just before the final incident, and in a few of the other eleven cases, this 
information was available from official records. Usually, however, there was little official 
record informa\-tion in the cases for which we were unable to obtain an interview.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Circumstances Immediately Preceding the Final Incident} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 83 of the 87 cases, we had information about the \'93causative factor,\'94 a code 
used by the Chicago Police Department to summari\-ze the motive, the type of 
altercation and the general circumstances surrounding the homicide. Of the 83 
homicides, 26 (31%) involved jealousy or infidelity, 22 (27%) involved the termination or 
attempted termination of the relationship (including forced entry by a rejected partner), 
19 (23%) were \'93general domestic\'94 altercations, five (6%) were alterca\-tions about drugs, 
ten (12%) were alterca\-tions about other things (usually money or sex), and one was 
caused by the offender\'92s \'93mental illness.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the 76 cases with interviews, however, we have more detailed information 
about the situation and circumstances immediately preceding the homicide. This 
section combines both official record and interview data to examine the interaction 
between the offender and the victim (if any), whether there was evidence of intent to 
kill, extreme jealousy, or lack of compliance with a demand just before the homicide, 
and whether one partner was had left, tried to leave, or announced an intention of 
leaving or ending the relationship just before the fatal incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Victim/Offender Interaction} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In 73 cases, we know something about the 
interaction of the couple just prior to the homicide. In 35 cases (all of them 
heterosexual), some type of violent physical inter\-action immediately preceded the 
homicide. In addition to these 35, four other homicides were immediately preceded by a 
threat to kill. Interviews indicated that the man had initiated the violence in 30 of the 35 
cases, but 16 of these were mutually violent altercations.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In two cases, both the homicide victim and offender were wounded in the 
violence that had preceded the final attack. The preceding violence involved pushing or 
slapping (eight cases); punching, kicking or hitting (five cases); striking with an object 
(seven cases); severe beating or being choked to unconscious\-ness (nine cases); and 
rape (four cases). Many of the violent episodes contained combinations of attack types. 
For example, one woman who was finally choked to death had been clubbed with a 
hammer and strangled with a cord beforehand.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In another 34 of the 73 cases, the couple had been arguing, but the argument 
was not physical. For example, one couple was visiting friends and the woman wanted 
to leave, but the man was too drunk. In four of these 34, there was a threat to kill. In the 
one same-sex homicide, the partners had been arguing just before the final incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In four of the 73 cases, all of which involved a man killing a woman, there was 
little or no interaction immediately prior to the fatal blow. In all four, the man specifically 
pursued her, apparently with the intention of killing her, and shot her when he found 
her. Two women were killed in their safe place. One was killed in the home she shared 
with the offender, when he was unexpectedly released from jail, entered their home and 
shot her while she was on the phone. One was tracked down on the street, pushed into 
an alley and shot. In two of the four, the man commit\-ted suicide after killing her. One 
man had written a suicide note to his family, then went to where she was staying, talked 
his way in, and shot her. In two cases, the woman had left or tried to leave the 
relationship, in a third, the man was extremely jealous of her, and the fourth woman 
was a potential witness against the offender in a murder case.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Intent to Kill} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In 60 cases, we have interview information about the homicide 
offender\'92s intention to kill. Interviews indicated that the offender intended to kill the 
victim in 35 (58%) of the 60 cases, including 66% of the 47 woman-victim cases. In four 
(31%) of the 13 woman-offender cases for which we had information, the proxy 
respondent said that there was intent to kill. However, all four of the women offenders 
who answered the question themselves said that they had not intended to kill.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Compliance with a Demand} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Another common occurrence immediately 
preceding the homicide was a demand from one partner for something (such as money, 
sex or drugs) from the other. According to interview information, in six of the 49 man-offender homicides, the man was demanding something of the woman, and in three, 
the woman was demanding something of the man. In three of the 26 women-offender 
homicides, the man was demanding something of the woman, and in two, the woman 
was demanding something of the man.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Jealousy or Suspected Infidelity} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In a review of studies of wife-killing across 
many societies, Margo Wilson and Martin Daly (1993:279) found that, \'93The majority of 
cases in every well-described sample were precipitated by suspected or actual female 
infidelity and/or by the woman\'92s decision to leave the marriage.\'94 In the CWHRS, the 
immediate motive for the homicide incident involved sexual jealousy or suspected 
infidelity in 27 (33%) of the 81 cases where there was information, 19 of 54 woman-victim cases (35%) and eight of 27 woman-offender cases (30%). One of the 19 
woman-victim cases in which jealousy was a motive was the one same-sex homicide 
for which we have informa\-tion. The man was jealous of the woman in 14 woman-victim 
cases and four woman-offender cases. The woman was jealous of the man in four 
woman-victim cases and four woman-offender cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The 27 cases include only those in which jealousy was clearly an important 
motive in the homicide incident itself. In one case, for example, a man who had been 
dating a woman for several weeks saw her in a bar with another man, walked in, and 
shot her. In the interviews, however, the CWHRS also gathered information about 
whether or not the woman\'92s partner had been \'93violently and constantly jealous\'94 in the 
year before the homicide, and whether the partner \'93was jealous and didn\'92t want her to 
talk to\'94 another man (or woman). In some cases in which jealousy was a motive in the 
homicide, there was information that the partner had been jealous in the previous year, 
but in other cases this risk factor was not present.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The partner\'92s jealousy was a common experience for most homicide women, as 
well as most abused clinic/hospital women. Of the 73 homicide cases with information, 
the woman\'92s partner had been jealous in the previous year in 60 (82%), somewhat 
higher than the 74% of the 235 clinic/hospital women who had experienced a severe 
incident and much higher than the 252 clinic/hospital women who had not (49%). 
Further, of the 60 homicide women whose partner was jealous in the past year, 
jealousy was an immediate precipitating motive in the homicide incident for 18 (30%), 
compared to three of the 16 (19%) homicide women whose partner was not known to 
have been jealous. For these three women, the people interviewed had no information 
that the partner had been jealous in the previous year, even though extreme jealousy 
was a motive for the fatal incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Leaving or Trying to End the Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Ending or trying to end the 
relationship was a common theme in the 87 homicides as well as in the histories of the 
497 women who interviewed as AW. Some of the homicide women who tried to leave 
were pursued and killed in their \'93safe place,\'94 their work place, or on the street.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to infor\-ma\-tion on leaving as an immediate precipitating factor of the 
fatal incident, the CWHRS has information on leaving or attempts to leave in the past 
year. Both or either of these could have happened. The homicide might have followed 
immediately or shortly after the woman told her partner that she was leaving. 
Alternative\-ly, the woman could have already left or tried to leave the relationship, and in 
the fatal incident, the partner tried to force her to return or punish her for leaving. In 
combination with these aspects of the incident itself, the women might have left or tried 
to leave the relationship one or more times in the year prior to the homicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Exhibit 96 presents the available information on leaving the relationship as a 
factor in the fatal incident. Of the 59 homicides of a woman victim, we have information 
about leaving as an issue in the fatal incident in 52 (48 interviewed cases and five non-inter\-viewed cases). In 12 of the 52 (23%), the woman was leaving or trying to leave 
during or just before the fatal incident. In nine incidents (17%), the woman had already 
left and the partner was trying to renew the relationship.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 28 homi\-cides of a man victim, we have information about leaving as an 
issue in the fatal incident in 23 (23 interviewed and neither of the non-interviewed). In 
one of the 23 (4%), the woman was leaving or trying to leave during or just before the 
fatal incident. In three (13%), the man was trying to leave the relationship. In two (9%), 
the woman had already left and the man was trying to renew the relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 18 of the 83 homicides about which we have information (22%), a precipitating 
issue was the presence of one of the intimate partners at the premises. In these cases, 
the couple had been interacting in a home, and then one had asked the other to leave. 
In 15, six woman-offender and nine woman-victim homicides, the woman had asked the 
man to leave the premises. In three, one woman-offender and two woman-victim homi\-
cides, the man had asked the woman to leave the premises. In 13 of the 15 cases in 
which the woman was asking the man to leave, he had invaded her home or other safe 
place, and in three of these he had violated an order of protection in order to do so. The 
man had invaded her \'93place\'94 in two other cases that did not involve \'93premises,\'94 one 
case in which he had forced his way into a car where she was sitting, and another case 
in which a homeless woman\'92s ex-boyfriend attacked her while she was sleeping in her 
usual spot in the park.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For 70 of the 76 interviewed cases, we have information about whether or not 
the woman had left, tried to leave, or tried to end the relationship in the previous year, 
or had asked her partner to leave. In many cases, this had happened more than once. 
Exhibit 97 shows the answer to the question, \'93During the past year, did she leave or 
stay apart from (the partner) or ask (the partner) to leave or stay apart from her?\'94 The 
46 women victims were similar to the 494 abused clinic/hospital women, in the percent 
who had left, tried to leave, or asked their partner to leave. However, more of them had 
asked the partner to leave. In contrast, the 24 women offenders were less likely to have 
left, tried to leave or asked their partner to leave (58%), compared to AW women (76%) 
or women victims (74%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Many partners of CWHRS homicide women used a threat to kill to dissuade the 
woman from leaving. As Wilson and Daly point out (1993: 281), \'93A credible threat of 
violent death can very effectively control people.\'94 This was true for 34% of the 37 
women homicide vic\-tims who had been abused in the past year and for 53% of the 22 
women homicide offenders who had been abused in the past year, compared to 38% of 
the 494 clinic/hospital women who interviewed as AW. Fifteen of the 16 women victims 
(94%) and eight of the ten women offenders who had received such a threat in the past 
year actually left, tried to leave or asked the partner to leave in the year before the 
homicide incident.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Multiple Victims or Multiple Offenders} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research has found that intimate partner homicides are less likely than other 
homicides to have multiple offenders, though it does occasionally occur (Block & 
Christakos, 1994). When it does occur, it often involves a contract killing, or a woman 
offender otherwise eliciting the assistance of another person, such as her current 
boyfriend, to kill a former intimate partner. However, in the two years of the CWHRS 
lethal data, there was no case with multiple offenders.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were multiple victims in four of the 87 cases. In each of the four, a man 
killed a woman intimate partner and one other person, the victim\'92s child in two cases, a 
niece in one case, and a possible sexual rival in one case. An ex-boyfriend killed his ex-girl\-friend and her new boyfriend}{\plain \f1 , saying, \'93If I can\'92t have her, no one can.\'94}{\plain \f1  A boy\-friend 
killed his girlfriend and her seven-year-old daughter, then fled the country. A woman 
was shot when she was six months preg\-nant; the baby was surgically delivered and 
died the next day of prematurity. A man suffering from severe mental illness killed his 
wife and teen-age niece and then himself. The proportion of \'93familicides\'94 is lower in the 
CWHRS than in Houston, Texas (Brewer & Paulsen, 1999) or Hamilton, Ontario 
(Martin, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1997; Wilson, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1995).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, in some incidents, another person was seriously injured. In one case, 
a man stabbed both his girlfriend to death and then attacked her 13-year-old daughter 
in order to keep her from calling the police. He left both for dead. In another incident, 
when a man who had been dating a woman saw her in a bar with someone else and 
shot her as she sat in the bar, another bar patron was wounded.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Place of the Fatal Incident} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though most of the homicides took place in the common home of the victim and 
offender (52%) or the home of the victim (22%), there was a difference in the homicides 
with a woman victim or a woman offender (Exhibit 98). Women victims were more likely 
to be killed in the offender\'92s home (15%) than were the men victims (4%). Women were 
also more likely to be followed or tracked down somewhere and killed. Two women 
were killed in their safe place, one in her work place and one in a tavern (she had not 
gone to the tavern with the offender), and four women versus one man were killed on 
the street.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The weapon given in Exhibit 99, above, for each case is the weapon that struck 
the fatal blow. There were commonly multiple weapons in the incident. In some cases, 
one partner had used a weapon on the other, but the first partner was then killed with 
another weapon. For example, when one man hit a woman with a garbage can cover, 
she became scared, grabbed a knife and stabbed him. A woman hit a man with \'93an 
object,\'94 and he shot her. A man chased a woman around with a shovel handle, she ran 
into another room, got a gun, and shot him. There were other cases in which there were 
multiple weapons available, but only one was used in the incident. One man, a drug 
dealer, had a loaded 45 automatic and an antique rifle, but killed his girlfriend with an 
antique sword and a showcase knife.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Although we did not have complete forensic data on the CWHRS homicides, the 
available information did support the common finding that intimate partner homicides 
often involve \'93overkill,\'94 that is, much more violence than was probably necessary to kill 
the person. One woman, who had left the offender and was living with a cousin, was 
tracked down by the offender, who was let into the apartment by the cousin and then 
waited until the woman returned. He then shot her twelve times before shooting himself. 
In another case, a woman had asked her husband for a divorce. He beat her with a 
hammer, strangled her until she passed out, then got a cord and strangled her again to 
ensure death. The children were there at the time.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In ten of the 57 (17.5%) incidents in which a man killed a women, he strangled 
her. In contrast, only 74 (1.5%) of the 4,689 incidents reported by the clinic/hospital 
women at the initial interview, and about which we have information, involved choking. 
However, by definition, when a woman was choked or grabbed around the neck, the 
CWHRS categorized the incident as \'93severe.\'94 Of the 311 severe incidents for which we 
have information, the woman was choked in 74 (24%). These non-fatal choking 
incidents occurred to 59 of the 373 women for whom we have information (16%), but in 
addition, 274 of the responding 490 women (56%) said that Name had \'93ever\'94 tried to 
choke her. One difference between the non-fatal and the fatal choking incidents was 
that none of the women in the non-fatal incidents was choked or strangled with any 
instrument, such as a cord or piece of clothing.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard 
{\plain \super\f1\fs19 \chftn }{}{\plain In some choking incidents, the woman had a weapon threatened or used against her, in 
addition to being choked or grabbed around the neck.}}}
}{\plain \f1  Of the ten women strangled to death, 
some kind of instrument was used in half (two electrical cords, one telephone cord, a 
belt and a braided cord).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The weapons used or threatened in the 4,974 non-fatal incidents that occurred to 
the 493 abused clinic/hospital women who completed a calendar history are most 
closely comparable to the weapon in the 59 homicide incidents with a woman victim. A 
firearm was threatened or used in 64 of the 4,944 non-fatal incidents about which we 
had inform\-a\-tion on weapon type, and a knife was threatened or used in 42 incidents 
(see \'93Char\-ac\-teristics of Violent Incidents\'94 section, above). Adding the 59 woman-victim 
homicide incidents to the 4,944 non-fatal incidents, there were a total of 5,003 fatal and 
non-fatal incidents of intimate partner violence or violent threat. Of these, a firearm was 
threatened or used in 87 (64 non-fatal plus 23 fatal), a knife was threatened or used in 
58 (42 non-fatal plus 16 fatal), another weapon was threatened or used in 48 (42 non-fatal and six fatal), and no weapon was threatened or used in 4,810 (4,796 non-fatal 
plus 14 fatal). Of the 87 firearm incidents, 23 were fatal (26%). Of the 58 knife incidents, 
16 were fatal (28%). Of the 48 incidents with another weapon, six were fatal (12%). Of 
the 4,810 inci\-dents with no weapon, 14 were fatal (0.3%). Thus, the fatality rate for 
firearm incidents and knife incidents was much higher than for incidents with another 
type of weapon or with no weapon.\par

Only 51 (8%) of the 639 clinic/hospital women who had a home said that there was a 
firearm in their home, including 12% of the women who had experienced at least one 
severe incident, 4% of the women who had experienced other types of violence, and 
1% of the women who interviewed as NAW. This section presents comparable figures 
for the homicide women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, homicide women were more likely than abused clinic/hospital women 
to have a firearm in their home. Of the 76 interviewed cases, we had information on 68 
(46 women victims and 22 women offenders), of whom 17 (25%) had a firearm in her 
home (23% of the victims and 30% of the offenders). This was much higher than the 
12% for the clinic/hospital women who had experienced a severe incident, or the 4% for 
the clinic/hospital women who had experienced other violence. However, this total 
figure is misleading. It was true only for homicide women who were living with their 
partner at the time of the fatal incident. Homicide women living separately from their 
partner were very unlikely to have a firearm in their home (Exhibit 100).\par

}{\plain \f1  \tab Of the 27 homicide women living separately from her partner, none of the 21 
women homicide victims and only one of the six women offenders had a firearm in her 
home (4% of all 27 women). This percent was slightly less than the percent for CWHRS 
women as a whole (8%) or the 7% for the 258 abused clinic/hospital women who were 
not living with Name at the initial interview. Despite having no firearm in her home, how\-
ever, ten of the 21 women victims were killed with a firearm, two in her home or just 
outside it and eight elsewhere. In addition, the single one of the six women offenders 
who had a firearm in her home killed her partner with a firearm. However, the murder 
took place in his home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In contrast, the 41 homi\-cide women who lived with their partner were much more 
likely to have a firearm in that joint house\-hold, compared to the 27 women living separ\-
ate\-ly. Eleven of the 25 women victim couples (44%) and five of the 16 woman offender 
couples (31%) had a gun in the home. By comparison, only 9% of the 175 abused 
clinic/hospital women who were living with Name at the initial interview had a firearm in 
their joint home. Further, a firearm was the homicide weapon for 11 of the 16 women 
(68%) who were living with their partner and there was a firearm in the home, all but 
one of whom were killed in their home. In contrast, a firearm was the weapon for only 
one of the 25 women where there was not a firearm in the home (4%), and that woman 
was killed at home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, for the 31 cases where the woman was living apart from her partner 
at the time of the homicide, we have information about whether the partner had a 
firearm in his or her household in 21, 15 woman-victim cases and six woman-offender 
cases. In 11 of the 15 (73%) and four of the five, the partner had a firearm at home. 
Thus, there was a firearm in the separate home of 71% of the 21 partners about whom 
we have informa\-tion. In nine of the 14 cases in which the partner had a firearm (64%), 
the murder weapon was a firearm, compared to none of the six other cases. In four of 
the nine cases, the murder took place in his home, two in her home and three 
somewhere else.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When there was any firearm in the home, at least one was usually a handgun 
and at least one was usually kept loaded. Of the 31 cases in which there was a firearm 
in some\-one\'92s home (the woman\'92s home, her partner\'92s home, their shared home, or any 
combination), there was at least one handgun in 24 (77%), and there was a loaded 
hand\-gun in 16 (52%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because the CWHRS did not have access to firearm trace information, we do not 
know whether or not the particular firearm in the home was connected in any direct way 
with the fatal incident. In some cases we do know, in fact, that any firearm kept at home 
was not the murder weapon, since the lethal weapon was not a firearm. Thus, the 
higher percent of homicide women who have a firearm in the household that they share 
with their partner does not necessarily indicate that the presence of a firearm increases 
the risk of being injured or killed at home with that particular gun. However, even 
though there is no way to know the exact mechanism, the presence of a firearm in the 
home could be considered a risk factor for death, in the sense that the homicide women 
were much more likely to have a firearm in their home than the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In summary, homicide women were much more likely to have a firearm in their 
home than clinic/hospital women, but only when they shared the home with their 
partner. When homicide women did not live with their partner, they were less likely to 
have a firearm in the home than clinic/hospital women. When the couple did not share a 
home, the women\'92s partner was very likely to have a firearm in the home.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Drug or Alcohol Use in the Incident} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Studies of intimate homicide victims have found percents ranging from 9% to 
50% of women victims had been drunk at the time of the incident, with rates for men 
victims usually higher. In North Carolina, Smith, }{\plain \i\f1 et al.}{\plain \f1  (1998) found that 9% of women 
victims versus 29% of men victims had blood alcohol levels over 200 mg at the time of 
death (a significant difference), and less than a third of the women versus just under 
70% of the men had been drinking. Campbell (1992) found that 14% of women victims 
and 52% of men victims were intoxicated when killed, and a third of both the men and 
women homicide offenders were intoxicated. Dawson and Langen (1994) found that 
about half of all victims and offenders of spousal homicides had used alcohol.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, there was information on alcohol or drug use in the incident for 
41 of the 57 cases where a man killed a woman, 25 of the 28 cases where a woman 
killed a man, and one of the two same-sex cases. Of the cases with information, 13 of 
the 39 (33%) women victims and 15 of the 24 (62.5%) men victims were drunk when 
they were killed. Six women (15%) and 12 men (50%) were high on drugs when they 
were killed. Four women and eight men victims were both drunk and high on drugs. Of 
the offenders, 13 of the 25 (52%) women and 19 of the 37 (51%) men were drunk 
during the fatal incident. Ten women (40%) and 19 men (51%) were high on drugs, and 
six women (24%) and 12 men (32%) were both drunk and high. In the same-sex 
homicide, both victim and offender were drunk.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In ten of the 35 (29%) women-victim homicides for which we have information on 
both partners, both the victim and offender were drunk, and in six (17%) both were high 
on drugs. In nine of the 23 (39%) woman-offender homicides for which we have infor\-
ma\-tion on both partners, both the victim and offender were drunk, and in six (26%) both 
were high on drugs.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab CWHRS homicides of a woman by a man tended to involve alcohol or drug use 
by the man much more often than the woman. In 10 of the 13 cases where the woman 
victim was drunk, the man offender was drunk as well; in all of the six cases where the 
woman was high on drugs, the man was high as well. In contrast, CWHRS homicides of 
a man by a woman tended to involve alcohol, drug use, or use of both substances by 
both partners.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though there was a relationship between the use of alcohol or drugs in the 
incident and whether or not the person had \'93ever had a problem\'94 with alcohol or drugs, 
this rela\-tion\-ship was not perfect. In 29 of the 36 incidents (81%) in which the woman\'92s 
partner was using alcohol and we had information, that partner had ever had an alcohol 
problem, and in all of the 30 incidents in which the partner was using drugs and we had 
informa\-tion, the partner had ever had a drug problem. Further, in all but four of the 37 
cases in which the partner had ever had an alcohol problem, and all but three of the 39 
cases in which the partner had ever had a drug problem, the partner was using either 
alcohol or drugs or both in the homicide incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research suggests that alcohol may be more likely to be involved in intimate 
homicide when the offender is a commonlaw spouse, rather than a husband. In 
Canadian homicide statistics (Johnson & Chisholm, 1989), alcohol was involved in 21% 
of murders of wives and 39% of murders of commonlaw spouses. This was confirmed 
by an examin\-a\-tion of femicides in Ontario over 21 years (Dawson & Gartner, 1998), 
which found that legal unions were significantly less likely than commonlaw or dating 
relation\-ships to have involved drinking or drug use at the time of the fatal incident (31% 
versus 61% and 54%, respectively). In addition, current versus estranged relationships 
were significantly more likely (47% versus 33%) to involve liquor or drug use.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  Though the numbers are small, there is some support in the CWHRS homicide 
sample for the Canadian findings. Only eight of the women victims were the wife of the 
offender, and none of them was drunk or high or drugs at the time of the incident, com\-
pared to five of the 12 commonlaw wives (for two wives and three commonlaw wives, 
the proxy respon\-dent did not know). On the other hand, three of the eight husband 
offenders were drunk or high on drugs during the incident, compared to 75% of the 12 
common\-law husband offenders. The only current versus estranged relationship for 
which there are enough cases to analyze in the CWHRS is boyfriend/ex-boyfriend. Of 
the 16 cases in which a woman was killed by her boyfriend, 38% of the women and 
62% of the men were drunk or using drugs during the incident. Of the nine cases in 
which a woman was killed by her ex-boyfriend, three of the women and two of the men 
were drunk or using drugs during the incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There does not seem to be a relationship between substance use and the 
weapon. For the 38 men offenders for whom we have information, seven of the 20 
(14%) who were using alcohol at the time of the incident used a gun in the homicide, six 
of the 20 who were using drugs (30%), and five of the 13 who were using both (38%), 
compared to three of the 11 who were using neither (27%). For the 23 women 
offenders, two of the 13 (15%) who were using alcohol, two of the ten who were using 
drugs and one of the six who were using both used a gun in the homicide, compared to 
two of the six who were using neither.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Contrary to what might be expected, substance use in the incident was not 
related to where the incident took place. Of the 74 homicides that took place in the 
victim\'92s or offender\'92s home, either the victim or offender or both were using alcohol or 
drugs in 20 (27%), compared to five of the 13 other homicides (38%). The one homicide 
in a tavern and one of the two in a car involved drinking, and three of the five homicides 
committed on the street involved alcohol or drug use.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall, someone was drunk in 44 of the 67 homicides (66%) for which we have 
information. In contrast, someone was drunk in only 2,034 (42%) of the 4,859 non-lethal 
incidents. In 215 of the 550 non-lethal incidents in which the woman was beaten up or 
worse (39%), someone was drunk. Thus, someone was more likely be drunk in the fatal 
than the non-fatal incidents. However, there was no difference between the lethal and 
non-lethal incidents in whether someone was high on drugs. In 16 of the 67 lethal inci\-
dents (24%), someone was high on drugs. This percent was similar to the 1,194 (25%) 
of all 4,859 non-lethal incidents, and a little lower than the 177 (32%) of the 550 
incidents in which the woman was beaten up or worse. There were also no significant 
differences in weapon used in the fatal incident by offenders who were high or not.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Availability of Medical Help} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each of the 87 incidents is unique and complex. In reading through the cases, 
we were struck by a few cases in which a series of circumstances turned a non-lethal 
incident into a lethal incident. These cases are difficult to categorize, but many involved 
the availa\-bility or the timeliness of medical help. In one incident, for example, the man 
locked all of the doors and hid the key, then attacked the woman. She grabbed the 
weapon (a knife), and slashed him. When she saw that he was injured, she called 911, 
but the paramedics could not get into the house to treat him and he bled to death. In 
another case, police records note that the victim, a man who was drunk and had been 
had been beating, choking and hitting his wife with a broomstick and then had been 
stabbed, was \'93uncooper\-ative\'94 when medical assistance came.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were also a few incidents in which the victim might not have died if he or 
she had been wounded in a slightly different part of the body or had received different 
medical care. One man, for example, was angry because they had run out of beer and 
began stabbing the woman. She grabbed the knife and stabbed him in the leg. The 
knife cut an artery and he bled to death quickly. In a another similar, case, the man was 
attacking the woman and her family with a phone, and she stabbed him in the leg. He 
walked out, but died several days later. The death of a homeless woman, who died 
many days after she had been beaten, may have been related to her inability to obtain 
and take the medicine that had been prescribed to keep her head from swelling.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Prior History of Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Homicide is often the culmination of a long series of violent incidents, and must 
be viewed in light of earlier violent incidents and threats. These 87 homicide incidents 
are no exception. Overall, 62 (85%) of the 73 homicide women in the CWHRS about 
whom we have information, including 42 (87%) of the 48 homicide victims and 20 (80%) 
of the 25 homicide offenders, had experienced some type of physical violence at the 
hands of their partner in the past year prior to the fatal incident. This was higher than 
Campbell\'92s (1992) study of Dayton homicides, in which she found police documentation 
that 64% of the 28 women killed by a man intimate partner had been physically abused 
by that partner prior to the homicide. The difference probably is due to the more 
exhaustive information available with the proxy interview methodology.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In three of the 76 cases in which we obtained an interview, we still had no 
informa\-tion about whether or not there had been prior violence in the relationship. In 11 
(15%) of the 73 homicide cases with information, that information indicates that there 
was no prior violence at all against the woman in the previous year. In six of these, the 
woman was the homicide victim and in five the woman was the homicide offender. (In 
the one same-sex case with infor\-ma\-tion, there had been prior violence.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The degree of violence that occurred just prior to the fatal incident does not 
neces\-sar\-ily reflect the level of previous violence in the relationship. All of the four 
women who were killed by a man without any other interaction in the incident had 
experienced serious and repeated violent incidents at his hands in the previous year. In 
the 34 fatal incidents that had begun with a verbal argument or a threat to kill, the 
woman had experienced at least one incident of violence or threat of violence at the 
hand of her partner in the past year in 28 (82%). In three of the 24 for which we have 
information, the most recent incident had happened within 24 ours of the death, five 
had happened the same week but not that day, and seven had happened the previous 
month but not that week. In 16 of the 23 incidents where there is information, the 
homicide offender had been the first to use physical violence against the eventual 
homicide victim in that earlier incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Cases with No Prior Violence Against the Woman} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In eleven cases, our informa\-
tion indicated that there had been no physical violence or violent threats prior to the 
fatal incident. These homicides were similar in many ways, such as the place and the 
circum\-stances, to the 62 in which there had been prior violence. However, none of the 
eleven victims was killed with a firearm, compared to 31% of the 62 victims where there 
had been prior violence. Eight were killed with a knife compared to 39% of the others, 
one was killed with a blunt instrument compared to 6% of the others, and two were 
killed by strangulation compared to 11% of the others. Many of these homicides 
involved sudden and explosive rage on the part of one of the partners, and in these 
situations the weapon used tends to be whatever happens to be at hand. Of the 11 
women, only five were living with the partner, and none of these had a gun in the home. 
Of the 62 abused women, 38 (61%) were living together, and 15 of the 37 with 
information (41%) had a gun in the home.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In only one of the 11, versus 33% of the others, was the incident precipitated by 
someone leaving or trying to end the relation\-ship. In fact, in four of the 11 (36%), the 
homicide was precipitated by an altercation about drugs or money, compared to only 
16% of the 62 homicides in which the woman had been abused. Thus, the situation of 
the incident itself was more salient for these 11 homicides in which there had been no 
prior violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Each of these eleven incidents involved a unique set of circumstances, which are 
summarized below:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were five cases in which a woman killed a man, and the interviews indic\-a\-
ted that there had been no prior violence. In two of these cases, we interviewed the 
woman offender herself. One woman said that the first time he had been physically 
abusive in their three-month relationship was the day of the fatal incident. She was 
trying to break off the relationship. He came to her apartment, refused to leave, 
threatened to kill her, the children and her roommate, raped her and threatened to 
sexually assault her two-year-old. At that point, she stabbed him. In the second case, 
we interviewed a proxy respondent as well as the woman herself. The respondent did 
not know, but the woman told us that there had never been any physical violence in the 
three months of the relationship. He grabbed her arm in an argument and she stabbed 
him.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the third case, the victim\'92s mother, who lived right above the couple in the 
same house and was a credible proxy respondent, said she had never heard any 
fighting between them. The fatal incident, however, was very violent, with the man 
coming home drunk and hitting, kicking and choking his wife, before she stabbed him. 
Another case was similar. The proxy respondent lived in the apartment upstairs and 
said there had been no fighting or separations in the nine-year marriage, and that the 
death was a great shock and mystery to the whole family. In the fatal incident, the man 
came home drunk and began striking his wife with a broomstick and choking her, when 
she stabbed him.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the fifth case, there had been prior violence against the man but not against 
the woman. In addition to the violence in the relationship, the woman had been arrested 
for attacking people on the street. In this case, she befriended a disabled man with a 
large trust fund, and eventually stabbed him.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were six cases in which a man killed a woman, and the interviews 
indicated that there had been no prior violence. In one case, we interviewed the victim\'92s 
mother, who had talked to her daughter every day and was certain that her daughter 
would have told her if there had been violence. It was a short-term relationship (three 
months) that the daughter had been trying to end when she was killed. There was some 
question about whether or not they were intimate partners, and the offender claimed in 
court that the motive was a dispute about money. However, the victim was stabbed 
multiple times and then strangled. In a second case, we interviewed members of both 
families, who said that there had never been any indication of violence in the five-year 
commonlaw relationship. There was very little known about the incident, but she died of 
multiple stab wounds.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In a third case, the proxy respondent was a friend who had lived with the couple 
since they were married and was very knowledgeable about the relationship, and said 
that the man had injured her five years previously, but there had been no violence in 
the year before the homicide. For five days before her death, she had talked about 
divorce and had asked him to leave, but he refused. He and his brother searched her 
things, found what they thought was evidence of infidelity, and confronted her. She 
confessed and he killed her. In a fourth case, the proxy respondent was a good friend 
of the home\-less woman who died at the hands of a former boyfriend. The friend said 
that there had never been any violence between the victim and the offender until the 
day he beat her up. She died several days later. The offender committed suicide after 
six months.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In a fifth case, we interviewed a very knowledge\-able friend, who told us that 
there had never been any signs of physical abuse, since the woman was being 
protected by a man who was the leader of a drug organization. The murder happened 
when she tried to break off the two-year relationship. Her family denied that the couple 
were intimate, but the friend knew about the relationship. In the sixth case, the two 
proxy respondents agreed that the offender was a drug addict who had taken all of the 
woman\'92s money and even had depleted the savings of her friends, who were trying to 
help her. However, there was never any indication of physical violence at any time in 
their six-year relationship. In the fatal incident, he became enraged because she tried to 
prevent him from taking money out of her purse, stabbed her repeatedly in a fit of rage, 
and also stabbed her young daughter.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In summary, nine of the eleven cases with no prior violence seemed to have 
begun when the man began attacking the woman in an explosive rage. In three of the 
five woman-offender cases with no prior violence, the man began the violence that 
ended in his death. One of the five was apparently a mutual argument, and in one the 
woman was the aggressor. All six woman-victim cases with no prior violence seem to 
have involved a sudden fit of rage in which the man attacked the woman. They show 
some similarity to the three woman-offender cases in which the man began the 
violence, except that there was no indication that any of the women who became the 
victim in the homicide had fought back.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Types of Violence Against the Woman in the Past Year} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Were the types of 
violence experienced by the 62 homicide women (42 victims and 20 offenders) who had 
experienced any violence at the hands of her partner in the past year similar to the 
types of violence experienced by the CWHRS clinic/hospital women who had 
interviewed as AW? For some kinds of violence, the homicide and clinic/hospital groups 
had similar experiences in the past year (}{\plain \f1 Exhibit}{\plain \f1  101). Almost all of both groups had 
been pushed, grabbed or shoved, under 20% had been forced to do something that 
she thought was wrong or illegal, and about half of all three groups thought that their life 
was in danger, or could be in danger.\par
\tab However, in many ways the homicide women, whether they became the victim or 
offender in the homicide, differed from the clinic/hospital women. More of them had 
been slapped (88% versus 66%); kicked, bit or hit with a fist (80% versus 57%); hit with 
an object that could hurt her (60% versus 36%); choked (57% versus 47%); threatened 
with or had a knife used on her (47% versus 23%); threatened with or had a gun used 
on her (35% versus 14%); or the violence was increasing in severity (48% versus 27%). 
For both groups of homicide women, the violence was more likely to have been 
increasing in frequency than for the clinic women (26%), but this was more common for 
the homicide offenders (67%) than the victims (46%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab However, two women victims and four women offenders had experienced neither 
prior violence nor controlling behavior from their intimate partner in the previous year. 
Both of the women victims were killed in the process of a robbery by the intimate 
partner, and one of the women offenders killed her partner to get money for drugs. In 
two of the four woman-offender cases, including the drug-related robbery, the woman 
had attacked and severely injured the man in the previous year, and the man had not 
reciprocated. Both of the other two homicides in which the woman offender had 
experienced neither physical violence nor controlling behavior in the previous year 
began with the man attacking the woman, though there was no information about any 
previous violence.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Homicide Followed by Suicide} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, ten offenders (nine men and one woman) killed themselves at 
the scene or immediately afterwards. Two men attempted suicide, one at the scene and 
the other soon after. Three more men killed themselves some\-time later that year. In 
addition, two men died otherwise immed\-iately after the homicide, one in the squad car 
from a suspected drug overdose and one when he took hostages after the murder.\par
\tab Thus, nine of the 57 men offenders committed suicide at the scene, a rate 
slightly under that found in Houston, Texas (Brewer and Paulsen, 1999) (Exhibit 103). 
Both cities had lower rates than the male-offender suicide rate in \'93couple\'94 homicides 
found in Albuquerque, New Mexico from 1978 to 1987 (Rosenbaum, 1990), or in 
Australian intimate homicides from 1989 to 1991 (Easteal, 1994). Ten of the 23 
Albuquerque men committed suicide (43%), and 31 of the 121 Australian men 
committed suicide (26%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One of the 30 women offenders committed suicide, a woman who had killed her 
husband. The proxy respondents in this case told us that she had been suffering from a 
terminal disease. It is very unusual for a woman to commit suicide following homi\-cide 
(Daly & Wilson, 1988; Nie, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999). In Canadian homicides from 1961 to 1983, 
none of the women killing a husband or commonlaw husband committed suicide, 
compared to 32.5% of the 807 husbands who killed their wives and 15.9% of the 314 
men who killed their commonlaw wives (Gillespie, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1998). We were able to find 
only two studies reporting a woman\'92s homicide/suicide. Easteal (1994) found that one 
of the 29 women offenders in Australian intimate homi\-cides from 1989 to 1991 
committed suicide (3%), and Rosenbaum found that one of the 13 woman offenders in 
\'93couple\'94 homicides in Albuquerque committed suicide (8%).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Many studies find that a homicide offender is more likely to commit suicide if the 
homicide weapon was a firearm (for reviews, see Rosenberg, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 1999; Miller, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., 
1999). For example, Gillespie, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1998:58) found that 50.8% of the 415 husbands 
who used a gun to kill their wives committed suicide, versus 13.0% of the 392 who did 
not use a gun, and that 36.6% of the 112 commonlaw husbands who used a gun 
committed suicide, versus 4.5% of the 202 who did not. In Australia, Easteal (1994: 
143) found that the offender committed suicide in two-thirds of the 36 firearm homicides 
of adult sexual intimates, but in only 11% of the 36 in which the weapon was a knife or 
sharp instrument, and 4.9% of the 41 in which the weapon was assault or strangulation.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS homicide/suicides, weapon was also a factor. Of the 19 men 
offenders who killed their victim or victims with a handgun, five (26%) committed 
suicide. In all five, the offender also used the handgun to kill himself. The only woman 
offender who committed suicide used a handgun for both the homicide and the suicide. 
One of the three men who killed their victim with a rifle or shotgun committed suicide, 
also using a rifle for the suicide. In total, then, seven of the 24 men or women (29%) 
and six of the 23 men (26%) who committed homicide with a firearm also committed 
suicide. On the other hand, only two of the 29 (7%) men and none of the 25 women 
who used another weapon or no weapon committed suicide. These include one of the 
15 (7%) men who killed their victim(s) with a knife or sharp instru\-ment, none of the five 
man who killed their victim with a blunt instrument or other weapon, and one of the nine 
who beat their victim to death or strangled her (the weapon was \'93hands, fists or feet\'94). 
One man stabbed himself to death after killing his wife and niece, and another man 
strangled her and then killed himself with gas from the oven.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Several studies have found a relationship between the offender\'92s age and 
whether or not he or she commits suicide following the murder. In North Carolina, 
homicide offenders who committed suicide were older than other offenders (Palmer & 
Humphrey, 1980:111). Of the 57 men offenders in the CWHRS lethal sample, one of 
the ten (10%) who were age 25 or younger committed suicide immediately, compared 
to five of the 35 (14%) men aged 26 to 40, and three of the 12 (25%) men aged 41 to 
55. The mean age of the men who committed suicide was 36.11, and the mean age of 
those who did not was 34.23, not a significant difference.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Studies also tend to find that white homicide offenders commit suicide more 
often than others (Palmer & Humphrey, 1980; Wolfgang, 1958). In Chicago, two of the 
nine (22%) Latino/Hispanic men committed suicide, as did two of the nine (22%) white 
or other men. The proportion of African/American/Black men who committed suicide 
was somewhat less (5 of the 34, or 13%), but not a significant difference.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Others (Rosenbaum, 1990; Block & Christakos, 1995) have argued that being in 
a legally sanc\-tioned relation\-ship, compared to being in a commonlaw or boyfriend-girlfriend relation\-ship, is related to the likelihood that a man will kill his intimate partner. 
Among the 57 men offenders, there were nine husbands, two of whom committed 
suicide, as did two of the eight commonlaw husbands, indicating no difference between 
marital and com\-mon\-law relation\-ship. Combining these two groups, four (24%) of the 17 
husbands or common\-law husbands committed suicide, compared to five (14%) of the 
36 boy\-friends, and none of the four ex-boyfriends.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were only four homicides in which more than one person was killed, all of 
which had a man offender. The offender committed suicide after two of these four homi\-
cides, compared to seven of the other 53 man-offender homicides (13%). In addition, a 
man who had killed his girlfriend and left her young daughter for dead (she survived), 
attempted suicide after the incident by jumping in a river, but when he did not drown he 
turned himself in to the police.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Nie, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 ., in an analysis of all homicide/suicides in Wisconsin FIRS (Firearm 
Injury Reporting System) data, found a high rate of alcohol usage in men who 
committed homicide/suicide (100% of the people were men). In the CWHRS, we had 
information for six of the nine suicide cases and 32 of the 48 other man-offender cases. 
In five of the six suicide cases, the man was either drunk (two cases) or high on drugs 
(one case) or both (two cases). Of the 32 other man-offender cases, five (16%) of the 
men were drunk, six (19%) were high on drugs, and eleven (34%) were both drunk and 
high. Thus, five of the six men who committed suicide were drunk or high or both (83%), 
compared to 22 of the 32 other men (69%). However, even though drinking or drugs 
may have been a factor in the homicide, the men may not have had a prior \'93problem\'94 
with either. In only three of the proxy respondents said that a man who committed 
suicide had ever had a problem with alcohol, and only four said that he had ever had a 
problem with drugs. Similarly, 64% of the proxy respondents for the other men said that 
he had ever had a problem with alcohol and 69% said that he had ever had a problem 
with drugs. The one woman who killed herself was using alcohol at the time of the 
incident, had a problem with alcohol, and did not have a problem with drugs.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab If the final incident had been preceded by any indication that the offender was 
depressed or suicidal, it would have obvious implications for prevention. An offender 
who plans to kill himself or herself might also decide to kill his or her partner or children, 
believing that they could not live or be happy without him or her. Alternatively, an 
offender could commit suicide in response to the homicide, either because he or she 
was over\-whelmed with guilt or because he or she was afraid of the consequences. 
Rosenbaum (1990) found that the offenders in homicide/suicide were much more likely 
to be suffering from depression, compared to the offenders in other couple homicides.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS homicide data, we do not have information on the man offender\'92s 
depression, but we do have information on prior suicide threats or attempts, for six of 
the nine man suicide cases and 41 of the 48 other man-offender cases. Of the six men 
who committed suicide, four had previously attempted or threatened suicide, compared 
to ten of the 41 other men offenders. The one woman had also attempted or threatened 
suicide. Thus, more than half of the offenders who committed suicide had threatened or 
attempted suicide in the past, compared to about a fourth of the other men offenders. 
By compari\-son, 32% of the 228 responding clinic/hospital women who had experienced 
severe violence in the past year, and 20% of the 253 other abused women said that 
Name had ever threatened or tried to commit suicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Another precursor of homicide/suicide might be the partner\'92s attempt to leave the 
relation\-ship. Rosenbaum (1990), for example, found that half of the woman victims in 
Albuquerque homicide/suicides had been in the process of \'93threatened separation.\'94 We 
have information about six of the nine man-offender suicides in the CWHRS, and in all 
six, the woman victim was trying to or had left the relationship that day or a few days 
prior to the final incident, or the man was trying to get her to come back. By 
comparison, 13 of the 42 other man-offender homicides about which we have 
information (31%) leaving the relationship was an issue in the fatal incident. In the one 
case in which a woman committed homicide/suicide, the man was trying to leave the 
relationship.\par
{\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: Homicide Incidents} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Analysis in this section showed the importance of risk factors that occur in the 
immediate situation of the fatal incident. It is important to realize, however, that incident-related factors were not of prime importance in every homicide. Very little happened in 
some homicides, other than the homicide itself. For example, in four cases, there was 
no interaction between the couple just prior to the fatal attack and there was every 
indica\-tion in each case that the man came into the situation armed and ready to kill the 
woman, usually tracking her down to do so.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Conversely, in those homicides where there had been no prior violence against 
the woman, the incident itself was one of the most important factors for understanding 
the reasons for the fatal violence. Nine of these 11 cases apparently began when the 
man suddenly attacked the woman in an explosive rage. In three of the nine, the man 
was eventually killed in the incident, but these cases did not differ from the six where 
the woman was killed, except that there was no indication that any of the women who 
became the homicide victim had fought back.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS clinic/hospital sample was specifically designed to reflect the popu\-
la\-tion from which most Chicago intimate partner homicide incidents originated. We 
chose sample sites because their clients were from areas of the city with the highest 
rates of intimate partner homicide, and we made extensive efforts to assure that 
screening and interview bias would be minimal. There is considerable evidence that the 
study succeeded in these sampling goals (see details in the \'93Clinic and Hospital 
Sample\'94 and \'93Sample Characteristics\'94 sections, above). However, the characteris\-tics of 
the 87 fatal incidents differed in many respects from the characteristics of the non-fatal 
incidents. Some of the key differences and similarities were the following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- One of the main factors distinguishing fatal from non-fatal intimate partner 
violent incidents was the weapon that was threatened or used. By combining the fatal 
and non-fatal incidents, we can estimate the fatality rate for various kinds of violent 
incident. The fatality rates for firearm incidents (26%) and for knife incidents (28%) were 
much higher than the fatality rate for incidents with another weapon (12%) or the rate 
for incidents with no weapon (0.3%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Homicide women who did not live with their partner were much less likely to 
have a firearm in their home than clinic/hospital women. However, over a third of 
homicide women who lived with their partner had a firearm in the household, compared 
to 9% of clinic/hospital women who lived with their partner. When the woman did not 
live with the partner, the partner had a firearm in his or her home in three-quarters of 
the cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Although the relationship was not strong, alcohol use was present more often 
in fatal than in non-fatal intimate partner violent incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The woman leaving or trying to end the relationship was an immediate 
precipita\-ting factor for 40% of the homicides of women victims, and for 13% of the 
incidents that led to homicides committed by women offenders.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women homicide victims and clinic/hospital women were similar to each other 
in the percent who had left, tried to leave, or asked the partner to leave in the previous 
year. However, only 58% of the women homicide offenders had done any of these 
things, compared to 74% of the women victims and abused clinic/hospital women 
(76%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In the great majority of homicides, whether the woman was the victim or the 
offender, she had experienced violence at the hands of her partner in the year prior to 
the fatal incident. The level and kinds of violence were similar in many ways to the 
violence experienced in the past year by the CWHRS clinic/hospital women. However, 
women homicide offenders were more likely to have been beaten up, to have been 
injured, and to have thought that their life was in danger.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Both women offenders and women victims were twice as likely to have been 
threatened with a gun or to have had a gun used on them in the past year and twice as 
likely to have been threatened with a knife or to have had a knife used on them, 
compared to abused clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The means of death for about a third of the women who had been choked in 
the previous year was strangulation, the means of death for half of the women whose 
partner had threatened or used a knife on her in the previous year was a knife, and the 
means of death for over half of the women whose partner had threatened or used a gun 
on her in the previous year was a gun.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Although Name\'92s suicidal behavior (threat or attempt) was not associated with 
the continuation of violence, severe or not, for the clinic/hospital women, it was associa\-
ted with homicides. A combination seen in many of the fatal incidents was the man\'92s 
suicide, together with the woman\'92s leaving or attempting to leave the relationship. 
Extreme jealousy was often part of this configuration as well. Therefore, the two Danger 
Assess\-ment items about Name\'92s suicidal behavior and jealousy may be especially 
important risk factors when combined with each other.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 76 homicide women in interviewed cases, the homicide offenders were 
much less likely to have a job (13%), compared to the homicide victims (51%) or to the 
clinic/hospital women (29%) (Exhibit 104). They were also much less likely to have a 
high school diploma (29%) compared to the women victims (63%) or the clinic/hospital 
women (52%). On the other hand, almost all (87% and 92%, respectively) of the homi\-
cide women victims and offenders had a personal income of her own that she 
controlled, more than the clinic/hospital women (74%).\par

(Recall that homicides with a woman victim under age 18 were not included in the

Like the women in the CWHRS clinic/hospital sample, the homicide women\'92s ages were 
related to the racial/ethnic group (Exhibit 105). Latina/Hispanic homicide victims tended 
to be much younger than the other women victims. The oldest Latina/Hispanic victim 
was 33, but the oldest African/American/Black woman victim was 54 and the oldest 
white or other woman was 42. Mercy and Saltzman (1989:597) found a \'93strong inverse 
relationship between age and the risk of spouse homicide for Black husbands and 
wives, but not for White husbands and wives.\'94 In the CWHRS, the age distribution of 
women homicide women victims was similar to that of clinic/hospital women of the 
same racial/ethnic group. However, women homicide offenders tended to be older.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab In the clinic/hospital sample, screened women aged 51 to 67 were less likely 
than younger women to be interviewed (see Exhibit 8, above). Therefore, we might 
expect some differences in age between the lethal and non-lethal samples. For all three 
racial/ethnic groups, however, the clinic/hospital women were just as likely to be in age 
group 51 to 67 as the homicide women victims. This indicates that any age bias in the 
clinic/hospital sample did not affect the sampling goal, to interview women who would 
be comparable to homicide women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The intimate partner couples were almost always the same racial/ethnic group as 
each other (Exhibit 106). This is generally true of homicides in Chicago (Block, 1985, 
1993; Block & Christakos, 1995), because it is one of the most segregated cities in the 
country (Massey & Denton, 1987). All of the African/American/Black homicide women 
were in a relationship with an African/American/Black partner. Eight of the nine Latina/Hispanic homicide victims were in a relationship with a Latino/Hispanic partner, and 
eight of the nine non-Latina white homicide women were in a relationship with a non-Latino white partner.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab In many of the 76 inter\-viewed cases, the official record data and the interview 
data differed on the relationship of the partner to the woman. Though the people inter\-
viewed agreed with the official record in 13 of the 14 \'93husband\'94 relationships, two of the 
13 called \'93commonlaw\'94 in official records were called \'93husband\'94 in the interview, and 
three were called \'93boyfriend. The most disparity between the two data sources was in 
the 46 rela\-tion\-ships called \'93boyfriend\'94 in official records. The interviewers agreed in only 
23 of the 46, calling 13 of them \'93commonlaw\'94 and ten \'93ex-boyfriend.\'94\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There were several reasons for the differences. \'93Ex-boyfriend\'94 is not a code in 
police records. It was added in the Chicago Homicide Dataset, based on descriptions in 
the CPD narrative, but there were still only two \'93ex-boyfriend\'94 cases in official record 
data, compared to 12 in interview data.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Both the official record and the people interviewed tended to use \'93commonlaw\'94 
to designate couples living together, and \'93boyfriend\'94 to designate couples living apart, 
but the people interviewed may have had more information about the couples\'92 living 
arrange\-ments. Whatever the reason for the differences between the two data sources, 
we decided that the interview data would be more closely compar\-able with the 
clinic/hospital interview data. Therefore, the analysis here (Exhibit 107) was based on

victims in Houston, Texas (Brewer and Paulsen, 1999), Chicago women killed by a man

or former girlfriend (Exhibit 108). Only eight of the 49 (16%) Chicago women were

}{\plain \f1 \tab Though many of the homicide women had left or tried to leave the relationship in 
the past year, relatively few of the interviews (17%) described the relationship as 
\'93former\'94 or \'93ex\'94, and most of these (12 of the 13) were ex- or former boyfriend/girlfriend. 
There was only one couple who had been legally divorced (ex-husband relationship). 
This is much lower than for the clinic/hospital women. Of the women who interviewed 
as AW, a total of 43% said that Name was an ex- or former partner at the initial 
interview, including 4% who were their ex- or former husband, 2% their ex- or former 
commonlaw husband, 32% their ex-boyfriend, 1% their former same-sex partner, and 
4% some other former relationship.\par

\tab Because the woman\'92s relationship tended to differ across racial/ethnic groups, 
how\-ever, the fairest comparison would be within groups. For African/American/Black 
homi\-cide women, the partner of the 36 victims was much less likely to be her husband 
(8%) than the 25 offenders (28%), with the victims the same as the African/American/Black clinic/hospital women (8%). However, the partner of both victims (28%) and 
offenders (32%) was much more likely to be her commonlaw husband than the clinic/hospital women (0.3%). In addition, the partner of victims (36%), offenders (32%) and 
clinic/hospital women (37%) were equally likely to be her boyfriend. Therefore, a com\-
mon\-law relation\-ship was more common for African/American/Black homicide women, 
and a husband relationship was much more common for the women offenders.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the eight Latina/Hispanic homicide victims, three (37%) were killed by their 
husband, two (25%) by their commonlaw husband, two (25%) by their boyfriend, and 
one (12%) by her ex- or former boyfriend. In comparison, Name was her husband for 
46% of the Latina/Hispanic clinic/hospital women, the commonlaw husband for 17%, 
the boy\-friend for 15%, and the ex-boyfriend for 7%. Considering the small numbers of 
homicide women, these percents are very similar.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The pattern of age disparity between CWHRS homicide women and their partner 
was very similar to the pattern of age disparity between abused clinic/hospital women 
and Name (Exhibit 109). In the two of the three homicide cases where the woman was 
at least 20 years younger than her partner, she was the offender in the homicide. One 
51-year-old woman shot her 71-year-old husband when he tried to leave the 
relationship, and a 24-year-old women stabbed her 63-year-old boyfriend after he 
kicked and punched her. The victim was a 23-year-old woman strangled and stabbed 
numerous times by her 55-year-old boyfriend when she tried to leave the relationship.\par

{\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnancy and Children} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Sharps, }{\plain \i\f1 et al}{\plain \f1 . (1999) found that two of 119 women (1.7%) in ten cities who had 
been killed by a man intimate partner had been pregnant at the time of death. This 
figure was higher in Chicago, with two of the 59 CWHRS women homicide victims 
(3.4%) and none of the 28 women offenders pregnant at the time of the fatal incident. 
Although 74 of the 690 responding women (10.7%) interviewed in the clinic/hospital 
sample and 42 of the 487 (8.6%) who interviewed as AW were pregnant at the initial 
interview, a goal of the CWHRS sample design was to include pregnant women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 76 CWHRS homicide women for whom we have information, only nine 
(12%) did not have any children (8% of the 26 women offenders and 14% of the 50 
women victims). On the other hand, 29 (38%) of the 76 homicide women (35% of the 
offenders and 40% of the victims) had no child living in her household (whether her own 
child or not).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The living arrangements of the homicide women\'92s children was also similar to 
that for the clinic/hospital women. Of the 24 women offenders with children, four had 
grown children living on their own, two had children under DCFS or foster care, three 
had children living with relatives, and four had some children living with relatives and 
some with her. Of the 41 women victims with children where there was information, four 
had grown children living on their own, one had children under DCFS or foster care, ten 
had children living with relatives, and five had some children living with relatives and 
some with her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In 25 of the 76 homicides with information, a child was present or in the home at 
the time of the incident. These 25 included 13 of the 50 women victims (26%) and 12 of 
the 26 women offenders (46%). In eight of these 25 homicides, a child found the body. 
In two cases, a child was killed as well as the woman victim. In one case, the three 
children in the home were injured as well. In another case, the victim\'92s daughter  was 
left for dead by the offender.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS women offenders were similar to the women victims, except that 
the offenders were more likely to live in a \'93blended\'94 household with children of a 
previous partner plus children with the partner who was killed. This may be due to the 
older age of the offenders, compared to the victims. CWHRS women victims were 
similar to Hamilton victims in the proportion who had children living at home who were 
not the offender\'92s biological children (Exhibit 110). Patterns in Houston, however, were 
much different than either Chicago or Hamilton.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab Overall, the 87 homicide women were similar in their characteristics to the 497 
abused clinic/hospital women. However, the homicide offenders differed from the 
homicide victims. This may have been due to characteristics associated with the 
woman\'92s racial/ethnic group, because Latina/Hispanic and white and other women were 
over-represented among the homicide victims. The following section discusses the 
analysis that sought to determine whether there were significant differences between 
the women who were homicide victims and offenders. In addition, for a fair comparison 
of the homicide women and the abused clinic/hospital women, it is necessary to 
consider only those homicide women who had experienced violence or the threat of 
violence in the previous year. This analysis is presented in the final section of Homicide 
Findings.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Are Same-Sex and Woman-Offender Homicides Separate Types?} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Analysis of the CWHRS homicides to this point has considered all 87 incidents 
as a whole (or all of the incidents for which there is information). However, the 87 
incidents include two kinds of homicide that possibly should be examined separately 
from the others -- same-sex homicides and woman-offender homicides. (See the 
Project Method\-o\-logy section, above.) Before looking at risk factors in more detail, it is 
necessary first to determine whether all 87 homicides are similar enough to each other 
so that we may combine them for this detailed analysis.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Were the two intimate partner homicides with a woman victim and offender 
sufficiently different from the 57 homicides with a woman victim and a man offender that 
they must be analyzed separately, or could we combine all 59 woman-victim homicides 
for analysis? Were the 28 homi\-cides with a man victim and a woman offender 
sufficiently different from the 57 homi\-cides with a woman victim and a man offender that 
they must be analyzed separately, or could we combine all 85 for analysis?\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Do Woman-Woman Cases Differ from Heterosexual Cases?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because there were only two same-sex homicides, and we were able to conduct 
an interview for only one of these, we can only answer this question in a very tentative 
way. However, the two same-sex incidents were similar in many ways to the other 57 
homicides of a woman victim. Jealousy was involved, and both parties had been 
drinking. The fatal incident was preceded by an argument, as were most of the hetero\-
sexual homicides about which we have information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab One exception is the murder weapon. Neither of the same-sex homicide 
offenders used a firearm. One woman was killed with a car, and the other with a blunt 
instrument. Neither woman was choked or strangled. In this aspect, these homicides 
are more similar to the 28 woman-offender homicides than to the 57 woman-victim 
homicides. On the other hand, the interviewed case had a long history of prior violence, 
including an incident of firearm violence in which the future homicide victim was 
wounded.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The two women killed by a same-sex partner were similar in many ways to the 
women killed by a male partner, and to the women interviewed in the clinic/hospital 
sample. The mean age was 31 for both groups of women in the clinic/hospital sample, 
and 32 for the other 57 women victims, ranging from age 18 to age 54, while the two 
women who were killed by a same-sex partner were ages 25 and 36. In the 
clinic/hospital sample, about a third of both groups had a full or part-time job, as did 35 
of the other 48 women victims about whom we have information. The one woman killed 
by a same-sex partner about whom we have information did not have a job and was a 
high school graduate.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Based on the above, our conclusion was that the two same-sex homicides in the 
CWHRS sample were similar enough to other woman-victim homicides so that we could 
reasonably combine the two groups in most analyses of other woman victims, with the 
exception of analyses of weapon. Therefore, further analysis will combine all 59 women 
victims (or all 50 for whom we obtained an interview). However, where possible, we 
note the specific characteris\-tics of the same-sex case.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Do Woman-Victim Cases Differ from Woman-Offender Cases?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS homicide data, the woman victims differed from the woman 
offenders in several aspects, such as level of education and employment status. In 
addition, the racial/ethnic group of the woman offenders differed, in that none of the 
offenders was Latina/Hispanic (Exhibit 111).\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab It would be misleading to compare the char\-ac\-ter\-is\-tics of all 59 woman-victim 
cases to all 28 woman-offender cases, because, as we have seen above, Latina/Hispanic women in the CWHRS tend to differ from African/American/Black women in 
many ways (for example, their marital status and their age). A comparison of all 59 
woman-victim cases to all 28 woman-offender cases could be confounded by the fact 
that there are Latina/Hispanic women among the victims but not among the offenders. 
Therefore, for most analyses, we cannot combine the woman-victim cases with the 
woman-offender cases.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Based on the difference in racial/ethnic group, we could not combine the women 
victims and the women offenders. However, if the African/American/Black women 
victims and offenders were similar to each other, it might have been possible to 
combine them for analysis. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an analysis 
comparing the charac\-te\-ris\-tics of women victims and offenders for the 
African/American/Black homicide women only. If the 27 African/American/Black women 
who became the offender in the homicide were similar in their characteris\-tics from the 
41 women who became the victim, it would be possible to combine all of the 68 
homicides to look at risk factors. If they differed sufficiently, we must analyze risk 
factors separately. Therefore, the following analysis compares basic demographic 
characteristics of the 41 woman-victim cases and the 27 woman-offender cases, for 
heterosexual homicides only.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Age} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of the 68 African/American/Black homicide women, the 41 who had been 
the offender in the homicide were significantly (Gamma = -.550, p < .002) older than the 
27 who had been the victim. Offenders\'92 ages ranged from 20 to 63 years, compared to 
18 to 54 years for the victims. Fully 43% of the offenders but only 12% of the victims 
were aged 41 or older. Only three (13%) of the offenders were 25 or younger compared 
to 13 (39%) of the victims.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Employment and Education} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Educational level was known for 50 of the African/American/Black homicide women. The 31 who had been the victim in the homicide 
were significantly (Gamma =.576, p < .008) more likely to have graduated from high 
school (36%), compared to the 19 who had been the offender (74%). Employment was 
known for 55 of the African/American/Black homicide women. The 33 who had been the 
victim of the homicide were significantly (Gamma = -.739, p < .000) more likely (58%) 
than the 22 who had been the offender (14%) to have been working at the time of the 
fatal incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Type of Union/ Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The relationship was known for 56 of the African/American/Black homicide women. Of the 23 who became the offender in the homicide, 
seven (30%) were the wife of their partner, compared to only three of the 33 (9%) 
women who became the victim in the homicide. In addition, only two of the 23 homicide 
offenders (9%) were in a former or \'93ex\'94 relationship with the man, compared to seven of 
the 33 victims (21%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Conclusion} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Of the 68 African/American/Black homicide women, the offenders 
differed significantly from the victims. The offenders were more likely to be older, to 
never have graduated from high school, to be unemployed, to be married to the man, 
and to be in a current instead of former relationship with him. In general, the women 
offenders appear to have fewer resources but to be in a more committed relationship. 
The large differences between these two groups indicate that an analysis of risk factors 
should be conducted on each of the two groups separately.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Before assuming that all of the homicide women victims should be combined 
together for analysis, however, we checked to make sure that there were no significant 
differences by the women victims\'92 racial/ethnic group. We found none. Of the 50 
women victims, there were no significant differences in their relationship with the 
partner who killed them, their education, or their employment. Therefore, all subsequent 
analyses were conducted separately for total woman victims and total women 
offenders, regard\-less of their racial/ethnic group.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 How Did Abused Homicide Women Compare to Abused Clinic/Hospital Women?} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab So that we could make reasonable comparisons between the CWHRS clinic/hospital women who had interviewed as AW, and the CWHRS women who were a 
victim or an offender in an intimate partner homicide, we focused only on the 62 
homicides (42 women victims and 20 women offenders) in which the woman had 
experienced at least one violent threat or attack at the hands of her partner in the year 
prior to the homicide.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Violence Prior to the Lethal Incident} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As we have seen (Exhibit 101, above), most of these 62 homicide women had 
experienced considerable violence in the previous year at the hands of the partner who 
eventually killed them. More abused women offenders had experi\-enced violence in all 
but two of the 16 categories, compared to the AW women and to the abused women 
victims.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS homicide interviews, we asked the proxy respondent to tell us 
about the most recent incident before the fatal incident, and we obtained information in 
33 of the abused woman-victim cases and 18 of the abused woman-offender cases. In 
51% of the 33 woman-victim cases, the most recent incident had occurred more than a 
month before the fatal incident, and the most recent incident had occurred within 24 
hours of the woman\'92s death in 6%. In 16% of the 18 abused woman-offender cases, an 
incident had occurred within 24 hours of the man\'92s death. In only 15%, the most recent 
incident had occurred more than a month prior to the fatal incident. In comparison, for 
283 of the 493 (57%) abused clinic/hospital women, and for 119 of the 238 women who 
had experienced severe violence (50%), the most recent incident had occurred more 
than 30 days before the initial interview.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Controlling Behavior} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Information was available on at least four of the five Power and Control scale 
responses for 38 of the 42 women homicide victims who had experienced violence or 
the threat of violence in the past year, and for 19 of the 20 women homicide offenders 
who had experienced violence or the threat of violence in the past year (Exhibit 112). In 
general, the partners of abused homicide women seem to have done fewer of these 
controlling behaviors than the abusing partners of the clinic/hospital women. It is difficult 
to know whether this difference was due to lack of knowledge on the part of the proxy 
respondents, or to a real difference in the partner\'92s behavior.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Stalking and Harassment} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For 40 of the 42 abused women victims and for 19 of the 20 abused women 
offenders, information was available from the proxy respondents on at least half (ten or 
more) of the 19 HARASS items. Because many proxy respondents did not know the 
answers to half or more of the HARASS items, we did not analyze the total HARASS 
scale score. However, differences on the individual HARASS items were sometimes 
revealing.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The partner of 13 of the 40 victims (33%) and seven of the 19 offenders (37%) 
had scared her with a weapon in the year before the homicide, compared to 27% of the 
abused clinic/hospital women. The partner of 13 of the 40 victims (33%) and three of 
the 19 offenders (16%) had threatened to kill himself or herself if the woman left or did 
not return to the relationship, compared to 30% of the abused clinic/hospital women. 
The partner of five of the 40 victims (12%) and one of the 19 offenders (11%) had  
threatened to harm the kids if the woman left or did not return to the relationship, 
compared to 8% of the abused clinic/hospital women. None of the women victims\'92 
partners, but one of the 19 women offenders\'92 partners (5%) had threatened to harm her 
pet, compared to 9% of the abused clinic/hospital women.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab According to the people interviewed, the abused women homicide victims were 
more likely to have been in a commonlaw relationship with their killer than the abused 
clinic/hospital women to Name. Eight of the abused African/American/Black women 
victims (25%) were in a commonlaw relationship with their partner, while only one of the 
338 clinic/hospital women (0.3%) said she was in a commonlaw relation\-ship with Name. 
This probably was not due to the proxy respondents defining relationships as \'93common\-
law\'94 rather than as }{\plain \f1 \'93girlfriend/boyfriend,\'94}{\plain \f1  because 37% of the homicide victims were in a 
girlfriend relation\-ship with the man who killed them, about the same as the 33% of the 
180 clinic/hospital women who had experi\-enced severe violence and 42% of the 158 
who had not.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Two of the six Latina/Hispanic abused homicide victims were in a commonlaw 
relationship with the man who killed them, more than the 15% of the 34 clinic/hospital 
women who had experienced severe violence or the 18% of the 71 women who had 
not, and one was in a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship, compared to less than the 15% 
for both groups of abused clinic/hospital women. None of the four white or other women 
victims was killed by a commonlaw husband, but two were killed by their boyfriend and 
one by her ex-boyfriend.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The relationship of the 19 abused African/American/Black homicide offenders to 
the man they killed was very different from the relationship of the clinic/hospital women 
to Name. Six of the 19 (32%) were the wife of the man they killed, compared to only 8% 
of the clinic/hospital women. Eight (42%) were the commonlaw wife, compared to 
almost none of the clinic/hospital women, and 21% were the girlfriend, compared to 
37% of the clinic/hospital women (33% of those who had experienced severe violence 
and 42% who had not). None of the abused women offenders was the ex- or former 
wife or commonlaw wife of the man she killed, which was not dissimilar to the low 
number for the abused clinic/hospital women (16 of the 338, or 5%). However, only one 
of the 19 (5%) was an ex- or former girlfriend, compared to 41% for the abused 
clinic/hospital women (41% for those who had experienced a severe incident and 41% 
for those who had not). Thus, women offenders were much less likely to be in an ex- or 
former girlfriend relationship with their partner, than either the clinic/hospital women or 
the abused homicide victims (19%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The length of the couple\'92s relationship at the time of the homicide was about the 
same as the relationship length for the abused clinic/hospital women. Of the 42 abused 
women homicide victims, six (14%) had been in the relationship for a year or less, 
compared to two of the 20 (10%) abused women homicide offenders, and 19% of the 
496 abused clinic/hospital women. Similarly, 15 of the 42 victims (36%) had been in the 
relation\-ship for 13 months to two years, and three of the 20 offenders (15%), compared 
to 19% of the abused clinic/hospital women. Only 11 of the 42 victims (26%) had been 
in the relation\-ship over five years, but eight of the 20 offenders (40%), compared to 
32% of the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Disparity Between Partners\'92 Ages} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The abused homicide women were no different from the abused clinic/hospital 
women in the disparity between their age and their partner\'92s age (Exhibit 114).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Leaving the Relationship} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The abused homicide women were similar to the clinic/hospital women who had 
experienced severe violence, in whether or not she had left or tried to end the relation\-
ship in the previous year. Of the 40 abused homicide victims with information, 31 (77%) 
had left or tried to end the relationship, and 13 (72%) of the 18 homicide offenders with 
information, compared to 85% of the clinic/hospital women who had experienced 
severe violence, and 34% of the clinic/hospital women who had experienced other 
types of violence. Three of the abused women victims and one abused women offender 
had asked the partner leave but he had refused, compared to 15% of the clinic/hospital 
women who had experienced a severe incident.\par

\tab Ten of the 19 abused women offenders with information had been limited by an 
emotional condition (53%), somewhat more than the women victims (40%). However, 
that condition was less likely to have been depres\-sion. Three of the nine with 
information about the specific emotional condition mentioned depression, with one 
respondent saying that the woman was depressed because she had been raised in a 
foster home and had no family. Several mentioned stress or \'93nervousness.\'94 One had 
had a \'93nervous breakdown about four years ago due to beatings and losing children.\'94 
Another had had a nervous breakdown in the previous month, and one woman was 
suffering from stress because of a new baby and a \'93restraining order against\'94 the 
partner. Proxy respondents said that one abused woman offender had a \'93character 
disorder\'94 and another just had a \'93mental problem.\'94 \par

{\plain \f1 \tab Of the 42 abused women homicide victims, we had information about their 
suicide threat or attempt for 36. Of these 36, only two had threatened or tried to commit 
suicide (6%). Of the 20 abused women offenders, we had information about 12, and 
none of these 12 had threatened or tried to commit suicide. By comparison, 38% of the 
233 responding clinic/hospital women who had experienced severe violence in the past 
year, and 29% of the other abused women, said that they had ever threatened or tried 
to commit suicide.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnancy and Children} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Only two of the homicide women, both victims, were pregnant when they were 
killed (3%), and both babies died. Nine additional women (13%) had been pregnant in 
the year prior to the homicide. By comparison, 42 of the 487 (9%) abused clinic/hospital 
women were pregnant at the initial interview, and another 94 (19%) had been pregnant 
earlier in the past year. (However, a goal of the clinic/hospital sample was to include 
pregnant women.)\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Of the nine homicide women who had been pregnant in the previous year, five 
had given birth to a live baby, two had suffered a miscarriage, and two had ended the 
pregnancy with an abortion, compared to 69% of the clinic/hospital women who had a 
live birth, 22% who had a miscarriage and 9% who had an abortion. However, the proxy 
respondents may not have been aware of a miscarriage or abortion for some of the 
homicide women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Only six of the 42 abused homicide women victims (14%) and two of the 20 
offenders (10%) had no children. This was less than for either the 494 responding 
abused clinic/hospital women (21%) or for the 207 NAW women (28%). Although the 
greater tendency to have children may have been a factor of their older age for the 
African/American/Black homicide women, that could not have been the explanation for 
the Latina/Hispanic homicide women, who were younger on average than the AW 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though homicide women were more likely to have at least one child, they were 
less likely to have children (theirs or others) living in their household. Close to half of the 
62 homicide women, including 18 victims (43%) and nine offenders (45%), were living 
in a household with no children, compared to 39% of the 201 clinic/hospital women who 
had experienced a severe incident and had a home and 32% of the 237 other clinic/hospital women who were living in a home. Some of the homicide women\'92s children 
who were not living at home were grown, but others were in the custody of DCFS or 
living with relatives or in foster care.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Having a child who was the stepchild of her partner was not a factor that distin\-
guished the abused homicide women from the abused clinic/hospital women. About the 
same proportion of abused homicide women as clinic/hospital women who interviewed 
as AW were had at least one child at home who was not the biological child of her 
intimate partner (Exhibit 116).\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Alcohol or Drug Use} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In general, abused homicide women and their partners were more likely to have 
\'93ever\'94 had an alcohol problem than abused clinic/hospital women and their partners 
(Exhibit 117). The 42 abused women homicide victims, however, were more similar to 
those clinic/hospital women who had experienced severe violence (38% versus 31% 
with an alcohol problem) than to the other women (17%). The 20 abused women 
homicide offenders were more likely to have had an alcohol problem (55%) than any 
other group of women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab These patterns generally held true for each racial/ethnic group, with some excep\-
tions. African/American/Black and white or other women were much more likely to have 
had an alcohol problem than Latina/Hispanic women, and Latina/Hispanic homicide 
victims were even less likely to have an alcohol problem than Latina/Hispanic clinic/hospital women. On the other hand, five of the seven Latino/Hispanic men homicide 
offenders had an alcohol problem, much more than Name in the clinic/hospital sample. 
The four white or other women homicide victims were much more likely to have an 
alcohol problem than any of the clinic/hospital counterparts, and all of the white or other 
partners had an alcohol problem versus about half of the partners in the clinic/hospital 
sample.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The abused homicide women generally were similar to the clinic/hospital women 
in whether or not they had ever had a drug problem, especially those clinic/hospital 
women who had experienced severe violence (Exhibit 118). On the other hand, drug 
problems were much more prevalent among the partners of the abused homicide 
women than the partners of the clinic/hospital women. Whether the partner was the 
homicide offender or the victim, about three-quarters had \'93ever\'94 had a drug problem, 
compared to about half of the partners of clinic/hospital women who had experienced 
severe violence. There was very little difference across racial/ethnic group.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The questions on the Social Support Network (SSN) scale were asked of the 
proxy interviewers, and most of them answered, but their responses were not reliable. 
For almost all of the SSN items, each proxy respondent told us that the woman did 
have support, tangible help in emergencies, and access to resources. However, the 
answers of the women offenders who were interviewed themselves were much less 
positive. It may be that the confidants of the couple were remembering the situation 
from their point of view, not the woman\'92s point of view. In retrospect, perhaps we would 
have received more accurate information from the proxy respondents if we had spent 
more time training the interviewers to handle these questions, and if we had included a 
more sensitive and elaborate introduction to this section.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, the only reliable information on social support and material resources 
for the lethal sample is information on material resources, plus factual information such 
as help-seeking activities or how long the woman had been living in Chicago. In 
general, the abused women offenders had fewer resources (employment or education), 
but the abused women victims had about the same level of resources, compared to the 
abused clinic/hospital women (Exhibit 119).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women homicide victims who had been abused in the past year were more likely 
to have a full or part-time job (49%) than clinic/hospital women in general (29%), and 
even more likely than those clinic/hospital women who had experienced severe 
violence in the past year (23%). In contrast, only 5% of the 19 abused women homicide 
offenders had a full or part-time job at the time of the fatal incident.\par

generally similar to those of the abused clinic/hospital women. About three-quarters had 
talked with someone about the incidents (81% of the 31 African/American/Black 
women, five of the six Latina/Hispanic women, and half of the four white or other 
women). This was somewhat higher than for the corresponding abused clinic/hospital 
women (75% of African/American/Black women, 64% of Latina/Hispanic women and 
62% of white or other women). Of the 26 who had talked with someone, 19 (73%) had 
found talking to have been helpful, slightly less than for the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Only five (13%) of the 39 victims with information had contacted an agency or 
counselor about an incident in the past year (four of the 29 (14%) 
African/American/Black women, none of the six Latina/Hispanic women, and one of the 
four white or other women). For African/American/Black women, this was about the 
same as the 15% of the 337 abused clinic/hospital women who had contacted a 
counselor or agency. For Latina/Hispanic women and white or other women, however, 
more abused clinic/hospital women had sought counseling help (22% and 31%, 
respectively) than homicide women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Eleven of 38 (29%) abused homicide women victims had sought medical help 
after an incident in the previous year (seven of the 28 African/American/Black women 
(25%), two of the six Latina/Hispanic women and half of the four white or other women 
victims). For African/American/Black women, this was about the same as for the 
}{\plain \f1 abused clinic/hospital women (30%), but less than for the}{\plain \f1  women who had experienced 
severe violence (43%). For Latina/Hispanic women, the number who had sought 
medical help was slightly higher than for the 34 clinic/hospital women who had 
experienced severe violence (29%), and much higher than for the other 71 
clinic/hospital women (6%). For white or other women, the number who had sought 
medical help was higher than for either the 22 clinic/hospital who had experienced 
severe violence (36%) or the other 20 clinic/hospital women (15%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Eighteen of 37 abused women homicide victims (49%) had contacted (or some\-
one else contacted) the police, 13 of the 28 (46%) African/American/Black women, two 
of the five Latina/Hispanic women, and three of the four white or other women. For 
African/American/Black women, this was comparable to the percent of the 180 clinic/hospital women with a severe incident (54%), and somewhat more than for the other 
156 clinic/hospital women (26%). For Latina/Hispanic women, the percent who 
contacted the police was about the same as the 34 clinic/hospital women who had 
experienced severe violence (44%), and more than for the other 71 clinic/hospital 
women (24%). For white or other women, this was much higher than for either group 
(59% and 15%, respec\-tively). When homicide women victims contacted the police, 
however, the police were slightly less likely to have been \'93helpful\'94 (56%), compared to

(66%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Previous research (Browne, 1986; Browne & Williams, 1989) had sug\-gested that 
avail\-ability of support ser\-vices for abused women was nega\-tively related to the risk of

to kill their abuser were less likely to have sought or received support, compared to 
women who had been killed by their abuser. In contrast, the CWHRS found that abused 
women offenders were more likely to have contacted the police in the previous year, 
though they were much less likely to have contacted an agency or counselor.{\super\fs19 \chftn {\footnote \pard

were the least likely to have contacted an agency or counselor (7%), compared to the 
others, or compared to abused women victims who were African/American/Black (14%). 
They did not differ in seeking medical help. However, they were the most likely to have

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Summary: How Did CWHRS Homicide Women Differ from Clinic/Hospital Women?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The analysis presented in this section focused on a comparison of abused 
women who were in fatal versus non-fatal situations. It compared the 62 homicide 
women (42 victims and 20 offenders) who had experienced violence or the threat of 
violence at the hands of their intimate partner in the previous year to the clinic/hospital 
women who had interviewed as AW. Some key findings of this analysis were the 
following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The violence experienced in the past year by abused homicide women victims 
was very similar to the violence experienced by the abused clinic/hospital women, in 
most types of violence. There were two differences. First, the violence was more likely 
to have been increasing in frequency and severity. Second, the homicide victims were 
much more likely to have experi\-enced an incident in which a knife or a gun had been 
threatened or used.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The violence experienced in the past year by abused homicide women 
offenders, on the other hand, was more likely to have been severe than the violence 
experienced by the abused homicide victims or by the clinic/hospital women. Abused 
women offenders were more likely to have been beaten, choked or burned, and they 
were more likely to have been hit with an object that could hurt her. Almost all of them 
had been slapped, kicked, bitten, or hit with a fist. The violence against the offenders 
was more likely to have been increasing in frequency than for either the victims or the 
clinic/hospital women, and like the homicide victims, the offenders were more likely than 
the clinic/hospital women to have experienced an incident with a knife or gun.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The most recent violent incident that the woman had experienced before the 
homicide occurred within the month for 49% of the women victims and 75% of the 
women offenders, compared to 50% of the clinic/hospital women who had experienced 
a severe incident and 36% of the other abused clinic/hospital women. For 16% of the 
abused women offenders, a violent incident had occurred within 24 hours of the 
homicide, compared to 6% of the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Almost three-fourths of the women homicide victims (74%) and over half (58%) 
of the women homicide offenders had left or tried to end the relationship in the previous 
year, compared to 85% of the clinic/hospital women who had experienced a severe 
incident and 66% of the other abused clinic/hospital women. In addition, an immediate 
precipita\-ting factor in 38% of the homicides of women victims was when the woman 
was leaving or trying to end the relationship. In 13% of the homicides by a woman 
offender, the incident began when the woman left or tried to end the relationship and 
the partner attacked her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Homicide women who had experienced abuse were about twice as likely to 
have been in \'93poor\'94 general health in the month before the homicide as were the 
abused clinic/hospital women in the month before the initial interview. This was true for 
both homicide victims and offenders. None of the 20 abused homicide offenders had 
been in \'93excellent\'94 health, and many more had been in \'93fair\'94 health in the month before 
the fatal incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Abused homicide women were more likely to have children than their clinic/hospital counterparts. On the other hand, they were less likely to be living in the same 
household as a child, either their child or another child, at the time of the homicide. 
They were no more likely to have a child fathered by a previous partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Abused homicide women were more likely to have \'93ever\'94 had an alcohol 
problem or a drug problem than were abused clinic/hospital women in general, but 
about the same as women who had experienced severe violence. However, the largest 
differ\-en\-ces in alcohol or drug use were for the partners of these women. Both the 
partners who became the victim and those who became the offender in the homicide 
were much more likely to have \'93ever\'94 had a drug problem, compared to the partners of 
the abused clinic/hospital women. The men who were killed were much more likely to 
have ever had an alcohol problem than were the abusing partners of clinic/hospital 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Abused women homicide victims tended to have more resources than women 
who became homicide offenders or clinic/hospital women. The were much more likely 
to have a full or part-time job (49%) than clinic/hospital women in general (29%), and 
even more likely than those clinic/hospital women who had experienced severe 
violence in the past year (23%). They were also more likely to have a high school 
degree (63%) than all clinic/hospital women (52%) or those who had experienced 
severe violence (46%).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women who became a homicide offender usually had experienced more 
severe and recent violence, and had fewer resources than clinic/hospital women or 
women who became a homicide victim. They were much less likely to have a full or 
part-time job (5%) or to have a high school diploma (18%) than any of the other groups 
of women. They were also more likely to be older, to have been suffering from an 
\'93emotional condition\'94 the month before the homicide, to have been in the relation\-ship 
with the man for five years or more, and to be currently married to him. The man they 
killed was much more likely to have ever had an alcohol problem and the women 
offenders themselves were somewhat more likely to have an alcohol problem than for 
the other women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Compared to their clinic/hospital counterparts, abused Latina/Hispanic women 
homicide victims were more likely to have talked to someone about the violence, but 
much less likely to have contacted an agency or counselor.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Compared to their clinic/hospital counterparts, abused African/American/Black 
women homicide victims were slightly more likely to have talked to someone about a 
violent incident, but were equally likely to have sought help from any formal resource.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In contrast, abused women homicide offenders were much less likely to have 
sought help from a counselor or agency than either their clinic/hospital counterparts or 
abused women homicide victims. However, they were much more likely to have 
contacted the police.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The Chicago Women\'92s Health Risk Study (CWHRS) was designed to give 
nurses, beat officers and other primary support people information they needed to know 
in order to help women being violently abused by an intimate partner lower the risk of 
life-threatening injury or death. Previous research did not provide this practical 
information. Although it told us who, in the general population, was most likely to be 
abused, it did not tell practitioners which abused women were in a situation where the 
risk of serious injury or death may be especially high. In addition, previous research 
tended to measure only one or two things, and did not take into account the interaction 
of events and circumstances as they change over time.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Field practitioners also need to know whether risk patterns differ for different 
racial or ethnic groups, for women in a same-sex relationship, or for pregnant women, 
and they need to be able to respond to women who may be in high risk situations but 
do not contact shelters or support networks.}{\plain \f1  Prior to the CWHRS, information about the 
needs and best interventions for these groups was very limited.}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The design of the CWHRS and the energy and dedication of the collaborators 
who made the design a reality produced a tremendously rich data set with the detail 
and the accuracy to answer the questions practitioners ask. We now can tell them 
combina\-tions of factors that indicate that a woman in an abusive situation is at high risk 
for serious injury or death. The \'93Conclusions\'94 section of this report reviews key findings 
and the most important conclusions of the CWHRS.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 The Stereotypical \'93Battered Woman\'94 Does Not Exist} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women\'92s lives are complex. Intimate relationships are sensi\-tive and private 
areas of a woman\'92s life, and there are cultural and racial/ethnic differences in how 
women may describe these relationships to a stranger such as an interviewer. 
Therefore, it is impor\-tant for both researchers and helping professionals to provide 
many opportunities for a woman to tell them about her relationship, without pushing her 
into the constraints of artificial categories. Interventions aimed at simplistic categories of 
women will not succeed, and research designs or practitioner protocols will yield 
misleading results.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS found that the challenges facing women who had experienced 
physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the past year differed for women 
at different points in the \'93abuse process;\'94 that risk patterns differed for women within 
differ\-ent racial/ethnic groups, for pregnant women, for women being abused by a same-sex partner, and for women who would become the offender in the homicide; that it was 
impor\-tant to consider risk factors relating to the particular incident as well as factors 
relating to the general situation in the previous year; and that it was also important to 
consider factors that were \'93protective\'94 or supportive for women in high-risk situations. 
This section outlines these findings.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 The Challenges Facing Abused Women Change Over Time} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many research analysts and domestic violence advocates have stressed that 
woman experience physical abuse as a process. The decision to leave, the definition of 
the situation as abusive, the collection of resources, all involve change over time. The 
CWHRS found that constellations of risk factors differed for women who were at 
different points in this process. The risks associated with whether or not a woman was 
physically abused by an intimate partner in the past year were not always the same as 
the sets of risk factors associated with the severity of that violence, and these differed 
from the factors associated with whether she would continue to be abused in the future, 
the severity of that future abuse, and whether death would be an outcome.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In fact, sometimes the same risk factor had the opposite association for women 
at different points in the abuse process. Take age, for example. Older Latina/Hispanic 
women were more likely than younger women to interview as AW, but those older 
women who did interview as AW were less likely to have experienced severe violence 
than younger women. African/American/Black older women were less likely to interview 
as AW, equally likely to have experienced severe violence in the past year, but more 
likely to experience severe violence in the future, and abused homicide women, 
especially women offenders, were much older than other abused women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab As an overview, Exhibit 121 shows whether or not each of a number of risk 
factors was significantly associated with interviewing as AW versus NAW; with 
experiencing at least one incident in the past year in which she was beaten up, choked, 
burned, or severely injured, or threatened or attacked with a weapon; with continuing 
violence in the follow-up period; and with becoming a homicide victim or offender. A 
\'93Yes\'94 signifies that there was a statistically significant associa\-tion between the risk 
factor considered by itself and the type of violence. (The \'93Yeses\'94 in the homicide 
column are based on large percentage differences, not on significance tests.) \'93No\'94 
signifies that there was no significant association.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though this overview cannot include all of the detailed analysis covered in the 
report, particularly the multi-variate analysis, it does illuminate patterns and connections 
across points in the abuse process. It makes it easier to pick out the risk factors that 
were extremely important for all CWHRS women, no matter where they might have 
been in the abuse process.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The factors that were never important for any group of women also stand out. 
For example, age disparity was not associated with intimate partner violence at any 
point in the process. In contrast, trying to end or leave the relation\-ship was impor\-tant at 
every point (though not always in the same direction; see below).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When all of the risk factors were combined in exploratory multiple regressions, 
certain of them stood out. For all of the clinic/hospital women taken together, five 
factors, in combination, were the most important factors associated with the severity of 
violence in the previous year. These factors were Name\'92s controlling behavior, Name\'92s 
harass\-ment and stalking, whether the woman had a PTSD diagnosis, whether she had 
a house\-hold income less than $5,000, and whether she had been in a relationship with 
Name less than 15 years.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Additional factors were important in the multiple regression analyses for 
particular groups of women. For African/American/Black women, whether she was the 
mother of four or more children was an additional risk factor. For Latina/Hispanic 
women, her \'93poor\'94 general health and having tried to leave or end the relationship in 
the past year were risk factors.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab White or other women who had \'93ever\'94 had a problem with alcohol and who 
scored high on the Power and Control scale were especially at risk of severe previ\-ous 
violence. For women who were pregnant at the initial interview or in the past year, 
having left or tried to leave and having a loaded gun in the home were important risk 
factors.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In sharp contrast, the most important factors associated with whether the woman 
would experience severe violence in the future were the number and recency of 
incidents in the past year and Name\'92s controlling behavior, combined with }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  having 
left or tried to leave the relationship in the past year. More personal factors, such as the 
type of union and relation\-ship, her children and stepchildren, her overall health, the 
partner\'92s suicide risk, her material resources, and alcohol or drug problem, were less 
important risk factors for future violence. When a woman had experienced frequent and 
recent violence, when she had also experienced controlling behavior, and when she 
was actively seeking help but had not left or tried to end the relationship, she was more 
likely to experience severe follow-up incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, both personal factors and past violence factors were 
important for homicide. Some factors that were not significant at other points were very 
strongly associated with women who became a homicide victim or offender. For 
example, though whether Name\'92s had threatened or tried suicide was not associated 
with continuing violence, the men who killed their partner and then themselves were 
much more likely to have threatened or attempted suicide previously. Homicide women 
victims and offenders were more likely to have children than clinic/hospital women. 
Homicide women were in much poorer health than clinic/hospital women, even though 
health was not associated with the continuation of violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Personal factors were especially important for women who became a homicide 
offender. They tended to have fewer material resources and less education, to be older, 
to be in poorer health, to be married to their partner, and to be in a long-term 
relationship, compared to women at other points in the abuse process. However, the 
history of violence was also important (for more detail, see below).\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Because we assumed that help-seeking and interventions in the past year were 
more likely to have been a result of the violence in the past year, rather than the other 
way around, associations with each type of help-seeking are not presented in the over\-
view table, above. (For these associations, see \'93Key Findings on Help-Seeking and 
Interven\-tion,\'94 below.) Women who had experienced severe violence and had also been 
actively seeking help in the past year, however, were more likely to experience an 
incident in the follow-up period. Compared to their clinic/hospital counterparts, abused 
Latina/Hispanic women homicide victims were more likely to have sought informal help, 
but less likely to have contacted an agency or counselor. Abused African/American/Black homicide victims were more likely to have talked with someone, but equally likely 
to have sought help from any formal resource. Women homicide offenders, however, 
were much less likely to have consulted a counselor or agency, and much more likely to 
have contacted the police.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Characteristics of the Incident Itself may be the Primary Risk Factor} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS focused on gathering information that would help to prevent one 
particular incident of intimate partner violence, the incident resulting in death. Research 
describes two different scenarios in intimate partner homicide. In one scenario, a 
regular pattern of violence eventually leads to a fatal incident, which is similar to those 
that preceded it, except that someone died. In a second scenario, some\-thing different 
happens in the fatal incident. Perhaps a weapon was used for the first time, the abuser 
threatened her child for the first time, or something prevented a wounded partner from 
receiving medical attention.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In the CWHRS, most women who became a homicide victim or offender had 
experienced violence at the hands of her partner in the previous year, but 15% had not. 
In addition, when the clinic/hospital women told us about only one incident, for 27% that 
single incident involved being seriously or severely injured or weapon threat or use. 
Thus, the first incident that happens may be fatal or life-threatening. Even in those 
homicides in which prior risk factors such as violence were important, aspects of the 
incident itself were important as well. Therefore, we must look at the incident itself if we 
are to understand the reasons for the fatal violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS clinic/hospital sample was specifically designed to reflect the 
popula\-tion from which most Chicago intimate partner homicide incidents originated, and 
there is considerable evidence that it succeeded in this sampling goal. Therefore, the 
4,974 non-fatal incidents the clinic/hospital women told us about can be compared to 
the 87 fatal incidents. Differences between the two provide an indication of the 
characteris\-tics of fatal incidents, compared to non-fatal incidents. Some of the key 
differences and similarities were the following:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- The use of a firearm or a knife was an important difference between fatal and 
non-fatal intimate partner violent incidents. The fatality rates for firearm incidents (26%) 
or for knife incidents (28%) were much higher than the fatality rate for incidents with 
another weapon (12%) or for incidents with no weapon (0.3%). Less than 2% of the 
non-fatal incidents, happening to 9% of the women, involved the threat or use of a 
firearm, but 40% of the women killed by a man were killed by a gun.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In the non-fatal incidents, it was much less likely for a firearm to be the weapon 
when the weapon was actually used, instead of being only threatened. A knife, 
however, was equally likely to be the weapon when it was threatened or used. One 
reason for this could be that the threat of a firearm was sufficient for Name to produce 
the desired effect in the woman, so that it was not \'93necessary\'94 for Name to actually use 
the firearm.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- A weapon was not necessary for the woman to sustain severe, life-threatening 
injury, however. Thirteen of the non-fatal incidents ended with the woman sustaining 
very severe or permanent injury, such as brain damage from being struck on the head, 
being choked to unconsciousness, or breaking her back when she was thrown out of a 
window, but this was done with no weapon other than the partner\'92s hands, fists or feet. 
In addition, 10% of the fatal incidents did not involve any weapon.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- In ten of the 57 (18%) incidents in which a man killed a women, he strangled or 
choked her to death. The woman was choked in less than 2% of all the non-fatal inci\-
dents, but in 24% of the most serious incidents. Only the fatal choking incidents 
involved a weapon.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Though Name\'92s suicidal behavior or threat was not associated with continuing 
violence, severe or not, the majority of those who committed homicide/suicide had tried 
or threatened to commit suicide previously. A combination seen in many fatal incidents 
was the man\'92s suicide, together with the woman\'92s leaving or attempting to end the 
relation\-ship. Extreme jealousy was often part of this configuration as well. Thus, the two 
Danger Assess\-ment items about Name\'92s suicidal behavior and jealousy may be 
especially important risk factors when combined with each other.\par
\tab -- Someone was more likely to be drunk in the fatal than the non-fatal incidents. 
In 44 of the 67 homicide incidents (66%) for which we have information, someone was 
drunk, compared to 41% of the 4,974 non-lethal incidents. In addition, the woman was 
more likely to experience severe violence in those non-lethal incidents in which she was 
drunk, compared to all other types of incident.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Past-Year Risk Factors for Serious Injury or Death in Intimate Violence} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In contrast to homicides in which the events in the incident itself were of primary 
importance, in other homicides there was no interaction between the couple in the 
incident prior to the fatal attack. In some of these, the man came into the situation 
armed and ready to kill the woman, usually tracking her down to do so. In looking for 
risk factors for all intimate partner homicides, but especially in homicides like these, it is 
important to consider factors outside the incident itself, such as the continua\-tion of a 
prior pattern of violence. This section sum\-marizes types of risk factors that were 
important for all groups of CWHRS women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Past Violence} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . In the great majority of homicides, whether the woman was the 
victim or the offender, she had experienced violence at the hands of her partner in the 
year prior to the fatal incident. The level and kinds of violence that had occurred prior to 
the fatal incident were similar in many ways to the violence experienced in the past year 
by the CWHRS clinic/hospital women, but the homicide women were more likely to 
have experi\-enced the more serious kinds of violence, and the violence was more likely 
to have been increasing in frequency and severity.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The ten cases in which the woman was strangled to death underscore the 
import\-ance of having been choked in a past incident as a risk factor for serious injury or 
death in a future incident. Therefore, the Danger Assessment question asking the 
woman whether or not an intimate partner had ever tried to choke her may represent an 
important risk factor for a fatal outcome.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A key question in assessing a woman\'92s risk of experiencing continued intimate 
partner violence was: \'93how long ago did the last incident happen?\'94 The most recent 30 
days were an especially critical period, with over a third of the clinic/hospital women 
who had experienced violence within the past month experiencing severe violence in 
the future. Half of the women homicide victims and 75% of the women offenders had 
experi\-enced a violent incident within the month. For 16% of the abused women 
offenders, a violent incident had happened within 24 hours of the homicide.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Controlling Behavior and Stalking} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Name\'92s controlling behavior and Name\'92s 
stalking and harassment were very strongly associated with the severity of violence in 
the past year and continued severe violence in the future, even when other risk and 
protective factors were taken into account. This was true for each individual 
racial/ethnic group, as well as for pregnant women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In some homicide cases, there had been no physical violence prior to the fatal 
incident, but the partner had demonstrated controlling behavior or harassment. For 
example, for many of the women for which the fatal incident began with the man 
suddenly attacking her in an explosive age, the woman had not experienced violence in 
the past year but there had been previous controlling behavior. Often extreme jealousy 
was involved in these cases as well.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Morbid Jealousy} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The partner\'92s extreme jealousy was an important risk factor for 
greater severity for all groups of women and at each stage of the abuse process. The 
partner of 82% of the homicide women was extremely jealous, and jealousy was an 
immediate precipitating factor in a third of the homicide incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition, when a clinic/hospital woman said at the initial interview that, \'93Name 
is violently and constantly jealous,\'94 she was more likely to have experienced severe 
violence in the past year and the violence was more likely to continue in the future. For 
women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year, Name\'92s jealousy 
was strongly associated with the severity of future violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Estrangement and Leaving the Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Leaving or trying to end the 
relation\-ship had a high potential gain for CWHRS women, but it also had a high 
potential risk. For clinic/hospital women who had not experienced a severe incident, 
leaving the rela\-tion\-ship could be a protective factor. In fact, women who had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  tried to 
leave or end the relationship were at higher risk for continued violence. However, if the 
violence did continue, it was likely to be more severe when the woman had left or tried 
to end the relationship. For women who had experienced at least one severe incident in 
the past year, on the other hand, leaving was }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  associated with future violence, in 
either direction.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A woman was at especially high risk for a serious incident on follow-up if she had 
asked her partner to leave, but the partner had refused. She was also at high risk when 
her partner had threatened to kill her if she left the relationship or, if she had left, she 
refused to return. In 17% of the homicides of women victims, the woman had already 
left and the partner was trying to get her to return. The man had invaded the woman\'92s 
home or other safe place just before 13 homicides, and in three of these the man had 
violated an order of protection in order to do so.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Almost three-fourths of the women homicide victims (74%) and over half (58%) 
of the women homicide offenders had left or tried to end the relationship in the previous 
year, compared to 85% of the clinic/hospital women who had experienced a severe 
incident and 66% of the other abused clinic/hospital women. In addition, the woman 
leaving or trying to end the relationship was an immediate precipita\-ting factor in 38% of 
the homicides of women victims. In 13% of the homicides by a woman offender, the 
incident began when the woman left or tried to end the relationship and the partner 
attacked her.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In summary, women who had experienced severe violence were more likely to 
leave or try to end the relationship, and the potential gain for them was great if they 
succeeded. However, her leaving was an immediate precipitating factor for over a third 
of the homicides of women victims. Thus, the potential risk was also great. Similarly, for 
women who had not experienced at least one severe incident in the previous year, 
leaving could also be protective, but only if she succeeded. Women who seemed to be 
able to end the violence by leaving or ending the relationship were often in relationships 
that were short-term (a year or less), more independent (had never lived together), and 
less committed (no children, not married).\par
\tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Weapon} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The presence of a firearm in the home was an important factor distin\-
guishing the abused clinic/hospital women from the homicide women. CWHRS clinic/hospital women were less likely to have a firearm in her home than were women 
nationwide. In contrast, the homicide women were much more likely to have a firearm in 
the home, but only when she was living with her partner. Over a third of the homicide 
women who lived with her partner had a firearm in their home, and 75% of the partners 
who were not living with the woman had a firearm in their home. However, almost none 
of the homicide women who were living separately from their partner had a firearm in 
her home. Many of these women were killed with a firearm, even though they did not 
keep one in their home. For these women, firearm \'93availability\'94 was not related to 
firearms in their own home or safe place, but to availability to the man who killed them.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who told us in the initial interview that an intimate partner had \'93scared 
them with a weapon\'94 in the past year were much more likely to experience severe 
violence in the follow-up period. In addition, women homicide victims and offenders 
were about twice as likely to have been threatened with a knife or gun or to have a knife 
or gun used on them than were other abused women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Physical and Mental Health} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Abused homicide women were much more likely to 
have been in \'93poor\'94 health, compared to the clinic/hospital women. The women 
homicide offenders were even more likely to be in poor or fair health than the victims. 
However, there was no associa\-tion between the woman\'92s poor health and continuing or 
severe violence in the future for the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who became a homicide victim were equally likely to have \'93been limited 
by an emotional problem\'94 in the month before the incident, compared to clinic/hospital 
women. Women who became a homicide offender were more likely to have been 
experi\-encing an emotional problem than either women victims or clinic/hospital women. 
However, that condition was less likely to have been depression for the women 
offenders than for the women victims.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Alcohol or Drug Use} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Compared to all abused clinic/hospital women and their 
abusing partner, homicide women and their partners were more likely to have \'93ever\'94 
had an alcohol problem or a drug problem. However, the abused homicide women and 
clinic/hospital women who had experienced severe violence were similar in this respect.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab On the other hand, the partners of abused homicide women, whether the partner 
became the homicide victim or the offender, were much more likely to have ever had an 
alcohol problem or a drug problem than the partners of the clinic/hospital women, even 
women who had experi\-enced severe violence.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Protective Factors} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Many of the CWHRS women who interviewed as AW had experienced multiple 
and severe high-risk factors in the past year, but did not experience continued violence. 
What were the \'93protective\'94 factors that distinguished these women from others?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A more distant relationship with Name was a protective factor. Women who had 
never lived with Name at all, or had not lived with Name at any time in the previous year 
were less likely to have experienced severe violence in the past year. Women who had 
been in a relation\-ship with Name for twelve months or less, and women who said at the 
initial interview that they were in an ex- or former relationship were more likely to have 
no violence to report in the follow-up period.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When Name had no controlling behaviors (scored zero on the Power and Control 
scale), the women was much more likely to escape future violence. In addition, women 
were more likely to escape future violence when they had said at the initial interview 
that there was someone she could \'93talk to openly about anything\'94 or that there was 
someone who supported her decisions.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Do Risk and Protective Factors Differ for Different Groups of Women?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though many of the risk factors for serious violence in the past year, continued 
serious violence, or fatal violence were the same for all groups of women, there were 
some differences for women in different racial/ethnic groups, for pregnant women, and 
for women in an abusive same-sex relationship. In addition, the pattern of risk and 
protective factors differed for those women who became the offender in the homicide, 
compared to the women who became the victim.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Latina/Hispanic Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Latina/Hispanic women, as a group, had experienced 
less severe violence, but were more likely to continue to experience violence. They 
were much more likely to become a homicide victim than a homicide offender. The most 
important risk factors for serious violence in the past year for Latina/Hispanic women 
were the partner\'92s harassment and stalking, her general health compared to other 
women her age, and having left or tried to end the relationship in the previous year. For 
continuing severe violence, the most important risk factors for Latina/Hispanic women 
were the recency of the most recent incident, Name\'92s controlling behavior, and }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  
having left or tried to leave in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Latina/Hispanic women who said that they had \'93poor\'94 health were much more 
likely to have experienced severe violence in the past year, but their health was not 
associated with whether they continued to experience violence in the future. In addition, 
Latina/Hispanic women who had experienced severe violence in the past year were 
more likely to be unemployed in the following year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Latina/Hispanic women were much less likely to have sought any kind of help, 
even those women who had experienced a severe incident in the previous year. In 
total, 21% had not sought any help, formal or informal, and well over a third (38%) had 
not sought help from any formal resource. Even fewer Latina/Hispanic women homicide 
victims had sought help from a counselor or agency in the year before her death.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 African/American/Black Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . For the African/American/Black women, the 
most important risk factors for serious violence in the past year were harass\-ment and 
stalking, Name\'92s controlling behavior, PTSD diagnosis, length of her relation\-ship with 
Name, and her total number of children. The most important risk factors for severe 
violence in the future were the number of incidents in the past year, her total number of 
children, }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  having left or tried to end the relationship in the past year, and having 
talked to anyone, contacted an agency or counselor, or contacted the police in the past 
year. Women who had exper\-ienced more incidents in the past year, who had more 
children, who had not left or tried to end the relationship, and who had sought formal 
help were more likely to experience severe violence in the future.\par
\tab African/American/Black women tended to have a stronger social support network 
than other women in the CWHRS samples. However, those African/American/Black 
women who had fewer resources and a weaker support network were at higher risk for 
severe violence in the past year, and for continuing severe violence. Abused women 
who became a homicide offender were likely to say that informal support (talking to 
someone) had not been helpful, were very unlikely to have contacted an agency or 
counselor, but were more likely to have contacted the police after an incident in the past 
year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 White or Other Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS clinic/hospital sample contained 43 white 
or other women who were being physically abused by an intimate partner, 26 of whom 
were followed-up. The 87 homicides included eleven white or other women. Based on 
these limited numbers, the most important risk factors for serious violence in the past 
year were the partner\'92s controlling behavior and whether the woman had ever had an 
alcohol problem. Because of the small number of cases, a combined analysis of risk 
factors for future violence could not be conducted. However, for this particular group of 
women, whether or not they had a high school education was an important risk factor 
for future severe violence. Unlike Latina/Hispanic women and African/American/Black 
women, younger white or other women were more likely to interview as AW and more 
likely to have experienced severe violence in the past year.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Pregnant Women} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . Pregnancy may have been a protective factor against intimate 
partner violence for some women. However, the risk of violence increased at the end of 
the pregnancy. Women who had been pregnant at the initial interview or in the previous 
year were more likely to experience continued violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For pregnant women, the most important risk factors for severe violence in the 
past year were harassment and stalking, if she had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left or tried to end the 
relationship in the past year, and having a loaded gun in her house. The most important 
factors associated with severe future violence were the number of incidents in the past 
year, Name\'92s controlling behavior, and if she had }{\plain \i\f1 not}{\plain \f1  left or tried to end the relationship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In addition to the risk to the woman, the baby was at risk as well. Pregnant clinic/hospital women who had experienced violence at the hands of her intimate partner in 
the past year were much more likely to have had a miscarriage (21%) than women who 
had not experienced a violent incident (6%). A miscarriage was even more likely to 
have happened when the violence had been severe and when the partner had beaten 
her when she was pregnant. The woman suffered a miscarriage after at least twelve of 
the non-fatal inci\-dents, and the baby died as well in the two homicides of pregnant 
women.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Pregnant woman were less likely than other women to have sought help from 
either formal or informal resources. This was true even of pregnant women who had 
experienced at least one severe incident in the previous year, and even though women 
who were pregnant or who had been pregnant in the previous year tended to have 
made many more health-care visits than other women. Almost a third (32%) had not 
sought help from a medical provider or from any other formal source after an incident in 
the past year.\par
\tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Women in an Abusive Same-Sex Relationship} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . The CWHRS sample contained 
18 women who were being physically abused by a same-sex partner, and two intimate 
partner homicides with a woman victim and a woman offender. Based on these very 
limited numbers, some of the risk factors for serious injury or death do appear to be 
different for women in abusive same-sex relationships com\-pared to women whose 
abusive partner is a man. Women were parti\-cularly at risk for serious violence when 
they had a PTSD diagnosis, and when they did not have the level of social support and 
acceptance measured by the Support subscale of the Social Support Network scale.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who were in an abusive same-sex relationship, compared to women in 
an abusive heterosexual relationship, were equally likely to talk to someone, consult an 
agency or counselor after an incident. They were somewhat more likely to seek medical 
attention. However, they were much less likely to notify the police, however, compared 
to women who were being abused by a man. The seriousness of the incidents they had 
experienced made no difference.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab {\tc {}{\plain \ul\f1 Risk Factors for Becoming a Homicide Offender} \tcl4}}{\plain \f1 . There were some strong and 
consistent differences that point to different risk factors for a woman becoming the 
homicide offender versus a woman becoming the homicide victim.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Women offenders had experienced more severe violence in the past year than 
either clinic/hospital women or women who became homicide victims. In the past year, 
she was more likely to have been beaten up, injured, choked, or attacked or threatened 
with a knife. She was more likely to have believed that her life was in danger, and the 
violence was more likely to have been increasing in frequency.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Compared to women homicide victims or to other abused women, women who 
killed their intimate partner were more likely to be in long-term, legally sanctioned 
relation\-ships, and were less likely to have social support networks and other resources. 
They were much less likely to have a high school education, and much more likely to be 
unemployed, and their health was more likely to be \'93fair\'94 or \'93poor.\'94 Women offenders 
were much more likely to be older than other women, to be married to their partner, and 
to be in a long-term relationship with their partner.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Having a firearm available in the home was a higher risk factor for women 
victims than women offenders. Forty percent of the women homicide victims were killed 
with a firearm, compared to 25% of the men victims. Forty-four percent of the women 
victims had a firearm in the home she shared with her partner, compared to 31% of the 
women offenders.\par

}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Standard Questionnaire Items Do Not Measure \'93Intimate Partner\'94} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Research often uses marital status as an indicator of the type of relationship 
between individuals, with \'93ex\'94 or \'93former\'94 unions indicating an estranged relation\-ship, 
and \'93co-habitation\'94 indicating an intimate relationship in which the partners are not 
married. In the CWHRS, we found that these constructs did not accurately represent 
women\'92s relation\-ships, and results based on them might well be misleading or 
incorrect. The CWHRS sample included many women, about a quarter of the sample, 
who were experi\-encing violence at the hands of an intimate partner, but who were not 
\'93married to\'94 and had never \'93co-resided with\'94 that partner. These women would not have 
been included in a research study that used marital status or co-residence as criteria for 
being in an intimate relation\-ship. \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Research Designs Must Capture the Complexity of Women\'92s Lives} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Questions about intimate relation\-ships are sensitive, and there are cultural and 
racial/ethnic differences in how women may describe these relationships to an stranger 
such as an interviewer. Therefore, it is very important to provide many opportunities for 
the woman to tell us about her relation\-ship, and to avoid constraining language as 
much as possible. Other\-wise, women in non-traditional intimate relation\-ships will be 
systematic\-a\-lly excluded. In addition, the CWHRS found that it helped establish rapport 
when we asked women to tell us about the real circumstances of their lives, without 
forcing them into pre-determined categories.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Develop a Collaborative Culture with Shared Research and Practice Standards} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The collaborative culture in the CWHRS was the foundation of the high quality of 
the data. Our collaboration included the development of culturally sensitive survey 
instru\-ments, the creation of safe and respectful interview climates, the problem-solving 
approach to finding ways to collect data safely and to retain women in the study over 
the twelve-month study period, the training and support of interviewers, collaborative 
interpre\-ta\-\-tion of the data, and the dissemination of results to a wide audience. The 
project became a catalyst for institutional change in many of the participating agencies, 
bringing them closer to universal screening for domestic violence.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Include \'93Strangulation\'94 in Reports of Homicide Data} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Information about whether or not the victim was choked or strangled is often 
collected by police departments and others who maintain homicide archive datasets, 
but seldom published. In reports of homicide research, cases in which the victim was 
strangled are usually scattered under various weapon categories, such as belt or scarf, 
and under \'93hands, fists, feet,\'94 but not presented as a separate figure. Public health 
records are even more restricted in the available information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Strangulation has never been seen as important, because very few homicide 
victims are killed by that method, overall. However, the CWHRS found that it is 
important for women killed by men. It may also be impor\-tant for victims who are young 
children, elderly or disabled. A substantial propor\-tion (18%) of intimate partner 
homicides of a woman victim by a man were committed by strangulation, and having 
been choked in a previous incident was a risk factor for being killed. In order to develop 
better preventive policies and interventions for these homicides, it is necessary to 
collect and publish information on strangulation in criminal justice and public health 
epidemiological datasets.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Key Findings for Practice} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 The High Potential Risk of Seeking Help and Trying to Leave} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
\tab Many of the findings of the CWHRS provide empirical support for things that 
advocates and practitioners have known through their experience. One of these 
findings was that leaving or trying to end the relationship placed women in a position 
where the potential for increased safety was high, but the potential for extreme risk was 
also high. Women who had experienced severe violence in the past year and who were 
making active efforts to obtain formal interventions to stop the violence, such as 
seeking help from a counselor or agency, contacting the police, going to court, or 
getting an order of protection, were at higher risk for continued severe violence. As 
domestic violence advocates know, it is important to help a woman who is beginning to 
seek help and is thinking of ending her relationship with an abuser to develop a safety 
plan that will increase her chances of the former, not the latter, outcome.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Ask Women: When Did the Last Incident Happen?} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab For the clinic/hospital women, the single most important risk factor for continuing 
violence was the length of the time period since the last incident. When the most recent 
incident had happened over six months ago, only 33% of the clinic/hospital women 
continued to experience violence on follow-up, compared to 60% of the other women. 
When the last incident had happened within 30 days, 63% continued to experience 
violence, compared to 47% of other women. In addition, the most recent violent incident 
for the abused homicide women tended to have happened only a few days before the 
homicide, within 30 days for 49% of the victims and 85% of the offenders.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Therefore, in talking with a woman about the past year, it is important to ask her 
when the most recent violent incident happened, even if the most recent incident 
involved only a threat with no violent attack or injury, and to be aware of the potential 
risks involved with delay of services. In addition, it is important to consider the specific 
support and intervention needs of women who have experienced a recent incident.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Do Not Judge a Woman\'92s Risk by a Single Incident, Even the Most Recent} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Though the recency of the last incident is crucial, the degree of severity of the 
most recent incident is not. One incident does not accurately represent the level of 
severity and risk of injury in the woman\'92s life. For example, even when the most recent 
incident was a threat with no violent attack or injury, over a third of the women had 
experienced at least one other incident in the past year that was very severe. For 27% 
of the 238 women who had experienced being beaten up, choked, burned, or worse 
during the past year, their most recent inci\-dent involved a threat or a slap or push with 
no injury.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab There\-fore, to access the degree of life-threatening risk for a particular woman, it 
is important to talk with her about her experiences over previous months, not just her 
most recent experience. Specifically, it is important to talk to her about whether the 
violent incidents have been recently increasing in frequency or severity. The Campbell 
calendar history is a good way to do this. The violence was much more likely to have 
been increasing in frequency and severity for the abused homicide women, compared 
to the clinic/hospital women.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 Inter-agency Coordination is Vital} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women experiencing violence at the hands of an intimate partner are not only at 
risk of serious injury or death, but at risk in many other ways as well. For example, fully 
42% of the 105 Latina/Hispanic women who interviewed as AW told us they had 
threatened or attempted suicide. Thus, practitioners who are talking with a woman who 
has experienced violence or a violent threat in the past year should be aware of the 
possibility that the woman may be suicidal. Similarly, those who work with pregnant 
women need to be aware of the association between intimate partner violence and 
miscarriage, as well as the risk that the violence against her will increase after the baby 
is born. In addition, professionals working in criminal justice or in medicine should be 
aware of their pivotal role as a gate-keepers for women to seek help from a counselor 
or agency.\par
}{\tc {{\plain \ul\f1 In Screening and Selecting Clients, Beware of Age Bias} \tcl3}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab At many points in the \'93process of violence,\'94 the CWHRS found that older women 
(aged 41 and above) were at equal or greater risk of serious violence or homicide. 
Women who were homicide victims, and especially those who were homicide offenders 
were much more likely to be older than age 40 than clinic/hospital women. Despite this, 
however, we found that our \'93universal\'94 screening tended to include older women less 
often.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Part of the reason for this may be that we looked only at violence that had 
happened in the past year. Many women said they were \'93currently afraid\'94 of their 
partner, but did not tell us about violence in the past year. This suggests two things for 
clinicians who are screening women for high risk of serious injury or death. First, make 
every effort to interview older women at greater length, and with sensitivity to their 
situation. Second, explore with women why they say they are afraid of their partner, 
even if they have not experienced recent violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 Key Findings on Help-Seeking and Intervention} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Almost all CWHRS women who had experienced severe violence in the past 
year had sought help from at least one type of resource after an incident in the past 
year (talking to friends, consulting an agency or counselor, seeking medical help, or 
con\-tacting the police). There were two exceptions. Latina/Hispanic clinic/hospital 
women were much less likely than others to have sought any help in the past year, 
even those women who had experienced severe violence. In addition, women who 
were pregnant were much less likely to have sought help or advice about the violence 
from any kind of formal resource, even medical care.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who had experienced more severe incidents usually had sought help 
from more kinds of sources. In general, the more severe the violence and stalking in the 
past year, the stronger the social support network, and when she had tried to leave or 
end the relationship, the more types of help-seeking the woman had tried.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The first type of help-seeking a woman tried was usually talking to someone. 
Like many other studies, the CWHRS women found these informal sources of help and 
support extremely important, but not always useful. Almost all women had tried to talk 
with someone in the past year about their situation, but the women who had not were 
more likely to experience continued violence. Homicide women were even more likely 
to have talked to someone, but were less likely than clinic/hospital women to have 
found talking with someone helpful. This was especially true for women who became 
the offender in the homicide, \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab When CWHRS women contacted some type of formal source of help, it was 
almost always in addition to informal support (talking with someone). However, of the 
formal types of help-seeking, contacting the police was the most likely. This was 
especially true for women who had experienced the most serious violence in the past 
year, and for women who became the offender in a homicide. The police seem to have 
played a \'93gate-keeping\'94 role for the CWHRS women, encouraging them and helping 
them to contact a counselor or helping agency.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  Seeking medical help was the third most likely type of help-seeking, and about 
equally likely for clinic/hospital women and homi\-cide women. Medical professionals, like 
criminal justice professionals, seemed to play a gate-keeping role, steering women to 
agencies or counselors. Because abused women had made more frequent health care 
visits in the previous year than had comparison women, medical professionals had 
frequent opportunities to offer help and advice. However, over a third of pregnant 
women who had experienced severe violence did not seek help from their medical 
provider or from any other formal source, even though they had made more health care 
visits.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women tended to seek counseling only when they had also sought medical care 
or contacted the police. Possibly the medical or law enforcement people helped or 
encouraged them to contact a counselor or agency. The clinic or homicide women least 
likely to have contacted an agency or counselor were those who became a homicide 
offender.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Women who were experiencing violence from a same-sex partner were much 
less likely to contact the police than women being abused by a man partner. This 
means that these women could not have benefited from the role of the police in 
enabling women to contact a counselor or helping agency. On the other hand, women 
in an abusive same-sex relation\-ship were more likely to have sought medical help. 
Therefore, the role of medical interven\-tion was especially important for women in an 
abusive same-sex relation\-ship.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Most CWHRS women told us that, when they sought help from medical and law 
enforce\-ment profes\-sion\-als, the person responded and offered a range of options, 
though some women said that help was not offered or the help was not useful. Some of 
the clinic/hospital women credited the police with helping them to end the violence. On 
the other hand, though many of the homicide women had sought and received help in 
the past year, that help had not prevented the death. A third of the homicide victims and 
offenders had sought medical, and half of the victims and almost 70% of the offenders 
had called the police.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Further analysis of the rich CWHRS data should explore the following questions:\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- What were the specific intervention and support needs of women who had 
exper\-ienced an incident recently? CWHRS women who had experienced a violent 
incident within the past month or week were at high risk for a life-threatening or fatal 
outcome. Did they have needs that were different from other women?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- What were the help-seeking and intervention exper\-iences of CWHRS women 
who were successful in ending the violence against her? What formal and informal tools 
did they utilize, and what advice do they have for other women?\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- What were the help-seeking and intervention experiences of CWHRS women 
who had not experi\-enced violence for over six months, yet who did experience 
continued violence in the follow-up period? Why did the violence stop and then start 
again? What did these women need that they did not receive?\par
}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\tc {{\plain \b\f1 A Final Word} \tcl2}}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab Lengthy and detailed as this report was, it still only scratched the surface of the 
analysis that could be, and should be, done with the CWHRS dataset. }{\plain \f1 Our primary goal 
in this report was to thoroughly document and explain the data. Therefore, the report 
traveled systematically and, we hope, exhaustively, through all of the information 
gathered in the CWHRS. We hope that this will become a foundation for further analysis 
of many issues, including the following:}{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- This analysis hardly touched the tremendous resource of the calendar history 
data. It presented and analyzed summaries of the woman\'92s experience over the retro\-
spective and prospective years, but did not look at the relation\-ships between clusters of 
incidents and events that changed over time for each woman. }{\plain \f1 One of the most 
important issues to explore with the calendar history data }{\plain \f1 is whether or not there was a 
change in the pattern of violence just before a life-threatening or fatal incident.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- One of the key findings of the CWHRS analysis in this report was that the 
relation\-ship between leaving or attempting to end the situation and the timing of 
violence differs for women in different points in the abuse process. For women in some 
situations, leaving or ending the relationship helps to protect her from further violence, 
but in other situations leaving or attempting to leave precipitates extreme or fatal 
violence. It is vital to be able to distinguish between the two kinds of situations, so that 
helping professionals can help women who are in a potentially dangerous situation 
build a strategic \'93safety plan.\'94 Data still unexplored in the CWHRS can provide this 
information.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- There is also much unexplored information in the CWHRS about the 
sequential relationship between the woman\'92s help-seeking activities, formal and 
informal interven\-tions, and violent incidents.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- CWHRS data contain many stories of women who have escaped from intimate 
violence situations. Though the analysis in this report reflected their experiences, it did 
not begin to use the depth of information available. A thorough analysis of what these 
women have done, how they stopped the violence, what protective or support 
resources they may have had available to them, whether or not they utilized formal 
interventions and their evaluation of the effectiveness of those interventions, would be 
invaluable for women in similar situations and the people who advise and try to help 
them.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- Analysis so far has not fully examined the validity of the Campbell Danger 
Assessment in predicting life-threatening violence.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab -- High on the agenda of domestic violence advocates has been the need to 
replace myths with facts (Okun, 1986). However, the movement itself has some 
strongly-held beliefs that have not been adequately tested with solid data. One of these 
is the Cycle Theory of Violence (Walker, 1979: 55-70). Despite the \'93controversy\'94 
surrounding it (see Walker, 1993; Bowker, 1993), the idea that most violent 
relationships cycle through three stages, tension-building, acute battering, and kindness 
and contrition (the honey\-moon stage), has become a given assumption for many 
workers in the field. But is it a fact or a myth? Does the Cycle Theory of Violence apply 
to all women in abusive situations, or does it apply only to some women in some types 
of situation? With the calendar history data of the CWHRS, it is possible to address 
these questions.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab We hope that the CWHRS dataset will inspire and support products aimed at 
many diverse audiences, not only academic research reports but also fact sheets, 
pamphlets and brochures that provide information to the people represented by the 
CWHRS clinic staff, the women in the clinic/hospital sample who worked with us for so 
long, and the proxy respondents who talked to us about the tragic events in their lives.\par

}{\plain \f1 \tab The designers of the Domestic Homicide Study wisely built into its design a 
debriefing component. The purpose of this component was to offer the research staff 
the opportunity to "debrief" or process the emotional impact and aftereffects that 
hearing women's stories could have on them personally. The training segment included 
some of the anticipated emotional effects inherent in this type of interview, as well as an 
introduc\-tion to stress management techniques to address them. Debriefing sessions 
were struc\-tured in a group format and planned weekly in the early stages, then bi-weekly, then resuming weekly meetings when the proxy interviews began. The format 
for the debriefing sessions was generally a combination of experiential stress reduction 
and relaxation techniques and verbal processing of the emotional, psychological and 
some\-times somatic reactions the interviewers were experiencing.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab During our initial training session the group identified a list of anticipated con\-
cerns, questions and areas of discussion that they wanted to address during debriefing 
sessions. Those topics of discussion were as follows:\par

{\plain \f1 \tab During the course of the study, all of those areas were addressed, some several 
times from different perspectives, depending upon what issues arose from experiences 
in the field. It should also be noted that in order to find respondents, the interviewers 
frequently went into very dangerous and unfamiliar neighborhoods in Chicago in the 
process of doing their field work. They went in pairs whenever possible, but generally 
by themselves. There was a high-risk element to this piece of their work, which was 
often processed in debriefing.}{\plain \f1  }{\plain \f1 \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The debriefing sessions provided a forum and opportunity for the interviewers to 
both discuss and process shared experience from their field work and to bond as a 
group in ways very reminiscent of a clinical support group.  By the final months of the 
study, this group of women had forged bonds and relationships, which will last long 
beyond the end of this particular project. The debriefing time became an important and 
prioritized piece of this study for the interviewers in this group, as it became a safe 
haven to unload the residual emotional aftereffects from listening to the painful stories 
of the respondents on an ongoing basis.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab From a clinical perspective, this scheduled "unloading" was an effective preven\-
tive strategy. It helped keep the researchers physically and emotionally healthy by 
preventing the buildup of unreleased chronic stresses, which could have resulted in 
varied post-stress symptomatology. The original intent, to provide that safe, confidential 
space for the interviewers, met and exceeded the designer's objectives.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The CWHRS design also incorporated a provision for interviewers to meet indi\-vi\-
dually with me in my role as a clinical social worker, in order to process confidentially 
what\-ever aspects of this work may have triggered past trauma or unresolved issues of 
grief and loss in their personal lives. Interviewers took the opportunity to use these 
individualized sessions as needed and, particularly at the end of the study, to bring 
closure to this work and to its personal impact.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab The positive residual benefits for each of the interviewers personally also 
exceeded anyone's imagination. As the study came to a close, the last month of 
debriefings were spent bringing closure, for the group as well as for each interviewer 
individually. One component of the closure process was to consider and share the 
impact of involvement in this project on each interviewer personally. Interviewers 
appreciated the stress management tools that each took from that piece of our 
sessions, which each interviewer will be able to use on an ongoing basis, personally 
and professionally. But, far beyond those practical benefits, were changes in the 
interviewers lives, such as career goals and plans, heightened awareness of the 
vulnerability of women in this country, adjustment in personal safety precautions for 
themselves and their children, and a sense of global connection to other women.  \par
}{\plain \f1 \tab A summary of the debriefing component of this study would be incomplete with\-
out mention of the particular group of interviewers who carried out this study in the field.  
This was a group of exceptional, strong, intelligent, creative, brave and tenacious 
women. As the clinical facilitator of their debriefing process, I was continually in awe of 
their willing\-ness to persevere under frequently trying and stressful circumstances and 
with their ability to connect with and engender trust among their respondents.  At the 
same time, they managed to maintain a healthy balance of empathy and objectivity.  
They each brought their own personal qualities of excellent listening and interviewing 
skills and compassion to their interviews.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab  While it wasn't the intention of this research study to assist the respondents to 
change their lives in any way (the interviewers were not social workers or counselors, a 
point that was regularly supported in debriefing), the interviewers inadvertently did help 
many of the respondents. This happened as a result of the interviewers\'92 ability to pro\-
vide a caring, authentic presence in which respondents were allowed to give voice to 
their stories and to their inner pain in a safe, non-judgmental atmosphere. No doubt, 
many women's lives have already changed in the process.\par
}{\plain \f1 \tab In summary, each interviewer found their debriefing experience to be meaningful 
and useful for them individually and also as a part of a bonded group. The consensus of 
the interviewers was that the debriefing sessions were an invaluable and beneficial 
component of their experience on this project. They provided the "glue" of continuity 
and support for this group of remarkable women interviewers. It was my honor as a 
clinician and facilitator to have been associated with them and with this very important 
research project.\par
